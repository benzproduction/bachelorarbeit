def main(myblob: func.InputStream):
    """
    Process the given blob, parse it into machine-readable text, slice it into segments, and store them in a Redis stack.

    This function takes an input blob and determines its mimetype. Based on the mimetype, the blob is parsed into
    machine-readable text. The text is then divided into segments, such as pages or slides, depending on the
    original file format. Each segment, along with its associated metadata, is stored in a Redis stack for further
    processing.

    Args:
        myblob (func.InputStream): The input blob containing the data to be processed.

    Returns:
        None
