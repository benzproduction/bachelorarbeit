New building activity did not start to pick up until 2012 onwards, long after the surge in immigration after the turn of the century. On an aggregated basis across top locations, only around 20,000 homes p. a. were built from 2002 to 2011. Thereafter, completion figures rose to over 50,000 units up until 2018. Rising purchase prices, rental growth and higher investor demand made new builds lucrative. Between 2016 and 2019, building permits for 60,000 flats and more were issued every year, which means that even higher numbers of units could have been built. Instead, however, housing construction has been slowing down again since 2019  falling to around 40,000 units by 2021. Building in towns and cities was hampered by the fact that the construction industry was working more or less at capacity, by a shortage of skilled workers and of materials, along with the emergence of protests here and there. Now though, the construction industry faces much stronger head- wind, and consequently, completion figures are likely to decline further. A shortage of materials is being compounded by a rapid rise in construction costs  above all a huge rise in the price of building materials  along with higher financing costs. A 30- year average shows that the cost of new build flats has increased by a good 3 per cent p. a. The increase in costs in 2018 and 2019 was considerably higher, but since 2021, it has been unprecedented: Construction costs rose by around 9 per cent in 2021 and, in the first half of 2022, they rose by almost 16 per cent! The cost of reno- vation has risen on a similar scale.",

Those rising interest rates are already driving up debt costs and thus the costs to acquire and develop property, reducing leveraged returns.

In addition, we analyze how opportunistic and value-add managers will need to adopt their strategies now that interest rates are higher, and how their ability to generate out-size returns simply by adding leverage is gone. So, a number of important topics for us and investors to consider. We hope you find our answers insightful and useful in determining your strategy and thinking about some of the key questions in real estate as we move into the new year. Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy. Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs. We have already started to see cap rates and yields rise in many markets, with the most rapid adjustment taking place in the UK. However, we do not think that prices fully reflect higher interest rates yet. To assess when values might bottom out, we can look to past downturns and the listed market for guidance. In the Global Financial Crisis, for example, global capital values bottomed out in 4Q09, while GDP across global real estate markets troughed three quarters earlier, in 1Q09, as did global listed real estate prices1. Market downturns usually present opportunities, and one we expect for investors in 2023 is a correction in pricing as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. Although we do not expect large amounts of distress in the market, we do expect some, already apparent in parts of the UK market. This should allow investors access to assets at attractive pricing. The early 1990s downturn was longer, with US capital values continuing to decline into 1995. We expect modest declines in GDP in the first half of 2023 before growth resumes.",

Australia is cementing its status as a safe haven in the region. Singapores relative attractiveness to Hong Kong is expec- ted to increase. Higher interest rates are less of a concern in Japan where the spread between the risk-free rate and real estate yields remains stable. A zero-Covid-19 policy, a troubled property sector and geopolitical tensions have led to a risk premium for China. Asia Pacific Macro-economic trends The Asia-Pacific region is expected to grow faster during 2023- 2025 compared with the U. S. or EU with a lower risk of recession. Within the region, and for the first time in decades, it is expected that Australia and Singapore will record higher quarterly GDP growth figures in Q3 and Q4 2022 than China. During the outlook period, China is expected to recover and follow its growth path but at a slower pace .

The one-year prime loan rate is currently 3.65. Rising inflation and higher interest rates are a concern for all Asia-Pacific markets, with the exception of China and Japan. Japan is keeping a lid on interest rate growth and its benchmark 10-year government bond rate remains close to zero. The spread between property yields and the risk-free rate is therefore intact. However, the Bank of Japans persistently low interest rate policy means that the exchange rate of the yen against the USD is now at a 50-year low.",

In Japan, yield curve control comes at the cost of a weak yen. If the Bank of Japan (BoJ) remains committed to keeping interest rates near zero, currency intervention, such as yen-buying to prevent further depreciation, could be on the table again. However, currency intervention has rarely been successful absent the cooperation from other central banks. Any changes to the yield control approach are likely to come after BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kurodas term concludes in April 2023. Nonetheless, most of the challenges Japan is facing are externally driven, while domestic-driven fundamentals remain relatively healthy.

The outlook of these economies is likely to follow AP.1 Diverging monetary policies in Asia Pacific the trends in the West, albeit to varying degrees. The Monetary Authority of Singapore manages monetary policies through the foreign exchange markets, given that for a small and open economy, the exchange rate has a much stronger influence on inflation than the interest rate. That said, the magnitude of interest rate hikes in Singapore has been less than that of the US. Additionally, an increasing number of firms are pivoting to Singapore for their regional headquarters due to its geopolitical stability. All of these are adding to the relative strength of Singapores economy. The weakness of Asia Pacific currencies is mostly a story of US dollar strength. Nevertheless, uncertainties over the macro outlook and the dispersion among regional economies could lead to the continuing divergence of real estate market performance in the next 12-24 months.

Within the region, and for the first time in decades, it is expected that Australia and Singapore will record higher quarterly GDP growth figures in Q3 and Q4 2022 than China. During the outlook period, China is expected to recover and follow its growth path but at a slower pace . Bouwinvest Outlook 2023-2025 21 Asia Pacific GDP Growth Asia Pacific Source: Oxford Economics, baseline scenario 2022 Q4 2023 Q4 2024 Q4 2025 Q4 Australia China Japan Singapore Hong Kong China usually props up its economy with direct measures such as infrastructure spending or fiscal support rather than adjustments to its interest rates. The one-year prime loan rate is currently 3.65. Rising inflation and higher interest rates are a concern for all Asia-Pacific markets, with the exception of China and Japan. Japan is keeping a lid on interest rate growth and its benchmark 10-year government bond rate remains close to zero. The spread between property yields and the risk-free rate is therefore intact. However, the Bank of Japans persistently low interest rate policy means that the exchange rate of the yen against the USD is now at a 50-year low.",

The denominator effect can be magnified because CRE values in a portfolio are generally appraisal-based, which tend to be backward-looking. However, the impact on CRE portfolios may not be severe this time. Many institutional investors have been under-allocated in CRE, so they will not need to rebalance by selling real estate assets. Furthermore, a rising share of CRE investors is not gov- erned by fixed asset allocations, including public REITs, private investment firms, and high-net-worth individuals, and especially nontraded REITs, which have grown to be among the leading investors in CRE, with an asset value of almost $300 billion in 2021. In sum, capital availability should decline in the near term, though the denominator effect may not force sales as much as in typical downturns. Uncertainty Hesitancy Perhaps the biggest headwind to getting deals done now is uncertainty over where prices will settle. Reflecting the views of many experts we interviewed, one senior investment banker says, Transactions are being done at cap rates that are anywhere from 25 to 75 basis points wider than they werebut there is not any conviction that these are the right levels. That translates into a 5 to 15 percent drop in values so far, with more to come. But there are too few assets trading now to know for sure. Buyers are concerned about overpaying. Says one banker: Now is not the time to be a heromeaning, its not the time to go out and be aggressive on buying something. Its not the time to be aggressive on borrowing. On the other hand, sellers dont want to sell their assets short and then see them retraded at higher prices once the markets improve and few suffer from the financial distress that forces them to. It all translates into fewer deals. One senior adviser to institutional investors said, Its pen- cils down in investment committee. We cant get an acquisition or disposition approved in investment committee at this time. The fundamental issue for many investors is how long the Fed will keep raising rates.",

The denominator effect can be magnified because CRE values in a portfolio are generally appraisal-based, which tend to be backward-looking. However, the impact on CRE portfolios may not be severe this time. Many institutional investors have been under-allocated in CRE, so they will not need to rebalance by selling real estate assets. Furthermore, a rising share of CRE investors is not gov- erned by fixed asset allocations, including public REITs, private investment firms, and high-net-worth individuals, and especially nontraded REITs, which have grown to be among the leading investors in CRE, with an asset value of almost $300 billion in 2021. In sum, capital availability should decline in the near term, though the denominator effect may not force sales as much as in typical downturns. Uncertainty Hesitancy Perhaps the biggest headwind to getting deals done now is uncertainty over where prices will settle. Reflecting the views of many experts we interviewed, one senior investment banker says, Transactions are being done at cap rates that are anywhere from 25 to 75 basis points wider than they werebut there is not any conviction that these are the right levels. That translates into a 5 to 15 percent drop in values so far, with more to come. But there are too few assets trading now to know for sure. Buyers are concerned about overpaying. Says one banker: Now is not the time to be a heromeaning, its not the time to go out and be aggressive on buying something. Its not the time to be aggressive on borrowing. On the other hand, sellers dont want to sell their assets short and then see them retraded at higher prices once the markets improve and few suffer from the financial distress that forces them to. It all translates into fewer deals. One senior adviser to institutional investors said, Its pen- cils down in investment committee. We cant get an acquisition or disposition approved in investment committee at this time. The fundamental issue for many investors is how long the Fed will keep raising rates.",

The bid- ask spread for private real estate should eventually close and transactions will resume in earnest at a rebased level.  In the meantime, investment styles that are less sensitive to volatility in values should be contemplated, such as floating-rate lending with a comfortable cushion from lower loan-to-value ratios. Debt investment can be attractive at times of uncertainty, as investors tilt toward contractually certain income and away from an uncertain upside. Portfolio aggregation strategies with smaller asset sizes that lend themselves to averaging-in with diversified timing of entry points represent another way to cope with volatile and uncertain values.  The inputs to the math are not changing to the same degree in every part of the world.

Europe Singapore Japan United Kingdom Australia Canada Source: Bloomberg. As of November 30, 2022. LOOKING AHEAD  The relentless math of higher interest rates will continue to weigh heavily on real estate values, at least until interest rates stabilize as inflation begins to subside. The bid- ask spread for private real estate should eventually close and transactions will resume in earnest at a rebased level.  In the meantime, investment styles that are less sensitive to volatility in values should be contemplated, such as floating-rate lending with a comfortable cushion from lower loan-to-value ratios. Debt investment can be attractive at times of uncertainty, as investors tilt toward contractually certain income and away from an uncertain upside. Portfolio aggregation strategies with smaller asset sizes that lend themselves to averaging-in with diversified timing of entry points represent another way to cope with volatile and uncertain values.  The inputs to the math are not changing to the same degree in every part of the world. Wherever rate spikes are less intense, or the prospects for rental growth are clearest, transaction activity and prices have been less impacted.  In addition to debt costs, investors should also consider the trajectory of cash flows, which depend on economic fundamentals and real estate occupier market conditions. The differential prospects for real estate cash flows are the subject of the next section.",

Currently, it seems that debt costs are mostly winning the race. Ultimately, however, valuations are the result of the interaction between higher debt costs and the path of real estate fundamentals, the prospects for which vary widely across sectors and geographies. Tracing back real estate cash flows to their drivers is to follow a chain of causation back to basic variables like population, GDP, industrial production, consumer spending and employment. All of these interact with real estate factors, such as the balance of property supply and occupier demand, to influence property cash flows. Secular megatrends and structural features like legal and contractual constraints also matter. Going into 2023, there is increased uncertainty in many of these variables, especially the economic ones, given the pace of economic expansion is expected to be weaker or negative. This will have a cooling impact on property NOI growth, but nuances remain given that the transmission of macroeconomic conditions to real estate is a winding path. Starting with the underlying economic fundamentals, we are seeing a great deal of variation globally.

The denominator effect can be magnified because CRE values in a portfolio are generally appraisal-based, which tend to be backward-looking. However, the impact on CRE portfolios may not be severe this time. Many institutional investors have been under-allocated in CRE, so they will not need to rebalance by selling real estate assets. Furthermore, a rising share of CRE investors is not gov- erned by fixed asset allocations, including public REITs, private investment firms, and high-net-worth individuals, and especially nontraded REITs, which have grown to be among the leading investors in CRE, with an asset value of almost $300 billion in 2021. In sum, capital availability should decline in the near term, though the denominator effect may not force sales as much as in typical downturns. Uncertainty Hesitancy Perhaps the biggest headwind to getting deals done now is uncertainty over where prices will settle. Reflecting the views of many experts we interviewed, one senior investment banker says, Transactions are being done at cap rates that are anywhere from 25 to 75 basis points wider than they werebut there is not any conviction that these are the right levels. That translates into a 5 to 15 percent drop in values so far, with more to come. But there are too few assets trading now to know for sure. Buyers are concerned about overpaying. Says one banker: Now is not the time to be a heromeaning, its not the time to go out and be aggressive on buying something. Its not the time to be aggressive on borrowing. On the other hand, sellers dont want to sell their assets short and then see them retraded at higher prices once the markets improve and few suffer from the financial distress that forces them to.

French and Spanish cities posted quarter-on-quarter yield increases of between 15 and 25bps. As risk-free rates are up and expected to remain elevated between 2023 and 2025, we believe office capital values could soften further during the outlook period, and we estimate prime yields in Europe will move out by another 50bps. This would amount to a value loss of around 10 to 15 before stabilization and recovery takes place.

We expect this latter trend to continue in the coming years, with Germany and France currently showing the most resistance to new greenfield developments. As a result, nominal rental growth, although slowing down, is expected to remain positive during the outlook period at a figure just shy of 3.0 per annum. Global supply chain disruption following the pandemic and ongoing geopolitical tensions are also fuelling a supply chain reconfiguration with a greater emphasis on onshoring over just-in-time. This is boosting domestic demand for logistics real estate and helping to ease wider supply chain pressures. European economic support programmes running until 2027 and totalling 1.1 trillion are expected to provide another boost to the sector.

                "text": " Property values dropped 10 to 20 percent as of midyear 2022 and capitalization rates are likely to keep rising as interest rates, the cost of debt, and risk premiums all move higher. Office values will fall more than other property sectors such as multifamily in which rising rents counterbalance higher cap rates. Plus, debt is becoming more constrained as lenders and bond investors are wary of the potential for increased risk of default if office tenants downsize. There is uncertainty in the cost and access to debt finance for office, noted one executive. The Emerging Trends survey confirmed that industry partici- pants are conflicted about pricing, favoring niche sectors such as medical office, and expecting that suburban offices will retain value better than center city offices. Conversions to Rise, but . . As tenants eschew older, lower-quality stock, that means that more office buildings are candidates for conversion. Obsolete 62 office buildings around the country are being converted to multifamily, industrial, medical offices, life sciences, and other uses. States such as New York and New Jersey are exploring legislation to ease the entitlement process around conversions. It makes perfect sense in Manhattan, where the office vacancy rate has shot up in Midtown as tenants chase new buildings in Hudson Yards and housing is in critically short supply. For example, New York developers Silverstein Properties and Macklowe Properties are converting office towers to apartments, and Hines is converting a tower in Salt Lake City. Even so, conversions remain sporadic relative to the new constructionnearly 150 million square feet of office space is under construction nationally, per Yardi Matrixdue to logistics. Conversions are costly and the stars need to be aligned with the right building configuration, floor plates, neighborhood ameni- ties, and demand, not to mention considerations such as tax structure. Each conversion stands on its own. Notes Moodys Analytics: The office-to-apartment conversion trend will likely be a minor one, unless office values and rents see some major, permanent decline after the pandemic. Finding an obsolete office building at the right price and asking rents, with high vacancy and the right floor plates to convert into an apartment building is great in theory, but hard to execute in todays market.",

Plus, debt is becoming more constrained as lenders and bond investors are wary of the potential for increased risk of default if office tenants downsize. There is uncertainty in the cost and access to debt finance for office, noted one executive. The Emerging Trends survey confirmed that industry partici- pants are conflicted about pricing, favoring niche sectors such as medical office, and expecting that suburban offices will retain value better than center city offices. Conversions to Rise, but . . As tenants eschew older, lower-quality stock, that means that more office buildings are candidates for conversion. Obsolete 62 office buildings around the country are being converted to multifamily, industrial, medical offices, life sciences, and other uses. States such as New York and New Jersey are exploring legislation to ease the entitlement process around conversions. It makes perfect sense in Manhattan, where the office vacancy rate has shot up in Midtown as tenants chase new buildings in Hudson Yards and housing is in critically short supply. For example, New York developers Silverstein Properties and Macklowe Properties are converting office towers to apartments, and Hines is converting a tower in Salt Lake City. Even so, conversions remain sporadic relative to the new constructionnearly 150 million square feet of office space is under construction nationally, per Yardi Matrixdue to logistics. Conversions are costly and the stars need to be aligned with the right building configuration, floor plates, neighborhood ameni- ties, and demand, not to mention considerations such as tax structure. Each conversion stands on its own. Notes Moodys Analytics: The office-to-apartment conversion trend will likely be a minor one, unless office values and rents see some major, permanent decline after the pandemic. Finding an obsolete office building at the right price and asking rents, with high vacancy and the right floor plates to convert into an apartment building is great in theory, but hard to execute in todays market.",

Meanwhile, apartment rents have continued to push ever higher, but the pace has been moderating in recent months. Construction starts also have slowed. The National Association of Home Builders housing market index has fallen for eight straight months through August 2022 to its lowest level since May 2020. This is not to say that were in a housing recessionfar from it. Homes are still selling at a healthy rate by historical levels, and home prices remain near record levels. And while multifamily vacancies are at their lowest level in four decades and rents continue to log new records every month, the rates of increase have been slowing and are expected to decelerate further, according to many experts we interviewed. Maybe you dont see the 10 percentplus rent growth in multifamily markets, says the head of one institutional investment advisory firm. They should come back to more of a long-term historical average of 3 percent to 4 percent, and maybe offset some of the unafford- ability in the country. Indeed, housing markets may be partly victims of their own success as record prices and rents mean fewer households can afford to buy homes or rent apartments, particularly with mort- gage interest rates and housing-related expenses like utilities 6 rising sharplya topic we explore in Too Much for Too Many, our trend on housing affordability. The Amazon Pause The white-hot industrial market also seems set to cool after sev- eral years of unprecedented demand growth and rent gains that have pushed rents far above prior records. Growth in e-com- merce is slowing and giving back some of the market share it captured from physical retailers during the pandemic. Amazon, the largest warehouse user in the United States, has delayed occupying numerous completed projects, trying to sublet many, as it slows its physical growthwhat some are calling the Amazon pause. Other major retailers also have been cutting back their distribution expansion plans. To be sure, the industrial sector still enjoys record-low vacancy rates, as demand for high-quality, well-located logistics facilities has been running ahead of the markets ability to supply them.",

                "text": " New home prices peaked in April 2022, while prices of existing homes likely peaked in June after appreciation started to slow with the rise in mortgage rates. Meanwhile, apartment rents have continued to push ever higher, but the pace has been moderating in recent months. Construction starts also have slowed. The National Association of Home Builders housing market index has fallen for eight straight months through August 2022 to its lowest level since May 2020. This is not to say that were in a housing recessionfar from it. Homes are still selling at a healthy rate by historical levels, and home prices remain near record levels. And while multifamily vacancies are at their lowest level in four decades and rents continue to log new records every month, the rates of increase have been slowing and are expected to decelerate further, according to many experts we interviewed. Maybe you dont see the 10 percentplus rent growth in multifamily markets, says the head of one institutional investment advisory firm. They should come back to more of a long-term historical average of 3 percent to 4 percent, and maybe offset some of the unafford- ability in the country. Indeed, housing markets may be partly victims of their own success as record prices and rents mean fewer households can afford to buy homes or rent apartments, particularly with mort- gage interest rates and housing-related expenses like utilities 6 rising sharplya topic we explore in Too Much for Too Many, our trend on housing affordability. The Amazon Pause The white-hot industrial market also seems set to cool after sev- eral years of unprecedented demand growth and rent gains that have pushed rents far above prior records. Growth in e-com- merce is slowing and giving back some of the market share it captured from physical retailers during the pandemic. Amazon, the largest warehouse user in the United States, has delayed occupying numerous completed projects, trying to sublet many, as it slows its physical growthwhat some are calling the Amazon pause. Other major retailers also have been cutting back their distribution expansion plans. To be sure, the industrial sector still enjoys record-low vacancy rates, as demand for high-quality, well-located logistics facilities has been running ahead of the markets ability to supply them.",
