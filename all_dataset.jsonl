The process by which investors integrate the infor- mation into investment decisions is currently opaque. The Challenge of Climate Risk Analytics Differences in climate risk analytics providers input data and methodology for estimating risk can make it difficult to compare results of analyses. For instance, within their product offerings, these firms often create summary metrics that aggregate the risk of multiple individual hazards. When aggregated, the weighting factors and hazards included vary by provider. Likewise, when calculating risk, providers may or may not include government, municipal, or asset-level risk mitigation considerations. Some providers, in addition to determining the likelihood of physical risk to assets, also calculate value-at-risk (VaR) to assets, where VaR represents the expected financial loss stemming from an event. Providers that offer a VaR measure tend to introduce further variation in outputs. This is due to the differences in how providers source the value of VaR. This figure from an institutional real estate manager depicts a set of aggregate risk scores generated by three different climate risk analytics providers for assets , dem- onstrating the challenge of translating complex climate science into business decisions. Considerations might include market value, the assumed percentage change in value, capital repair estimates, replace- ment cost, assumed business interruption loss, or assumed mitigation costs. Indirect considerations, such as ownership structure, structure of the capital stack, lease considerations, and insured amount, may or may not be factored in. Needless to say, it is easy to see why a wide variation in prediction patterns is prevalent across providers. Improving Decision-Making with Climate Risk Analytics To overcome these challenges of variability between climate risk analytics providers outputs, it is necessary for institu- tional real estate managers to carefully articulate their use case needsspecifically regarding valuation and value-at- risk. The climate risk analytics provider community can, in turn, benefit from sharing more about their approaches and the strengths and limits of models and physical risk data. To the extent that these conversations can be continuous and earnest, they will help guide both industries forward.
