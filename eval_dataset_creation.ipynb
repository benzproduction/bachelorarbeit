       "' What is the outlook for building new rental flats? Rents would have to rise sharply to cover construction costs and higher interest rates 45 The impact on building projects is illustrated by a survey of members carried out by the GdW. Around two thirds of members are planning to shelve new build renovation projects for the time being. Around one quarter are planning to give up new building projects altogether. Around 13 per cent intend to abstain from renovation projects. Bearing in mind the time it takes to complete building projects, the number of flat completions could fall noticeably from 2024 onwards, thus compounding the short- age of available flats. Urgently needed work to retrofit the existing housing stock is also stalling. Residential rents continued to rise in 2022 as well Residential rents in top locations continued to rise in 2022. On average, they rose by around 2.5 per cent yoy across the seven cities. This means a more moderate rate than the average annual rent rise of over 4 per cent in the last ten years. This slower rent rise is likely to be related to already high rents and moreover to the fact that the population growth has come to a halt. Moreover, the level of initial rents is also being dampened by an improvement in supply through a rise in the number of completions. Unlike in previous years from 2010 onwards, rents have risen slower than inflation since the end of 2021. At the half-way point in 2022, the average initial rent in top locations ranged from EUR 13.80 per m2 in Dsseldorf to EUR 20.80 per m2 in Munich. The average initial rent across the seven cities was around EUR 16.50 per m2. It rose by over 50 per cent over ten years. By comparison, the average rent for re-lets is EUR 13.70 per m2. In this case, the ten-year percentage increase is in line with that of initial rents.'"

      "[Text]:  This is understandable from the sellers perspective, since the modest in- crease in rental yields from their previously low levels has led to visibly low purchase prices. We expect the buyers and sellers sides to converge in the months ahead, causing investment volume to pick up again. Given that bond yields remain low, real estate remains an alternative worth considering, especially as the inflation-indexed commercial leases lead to rising rental income, which has a positive impact on achievable yields and thus also on purchase prices. The higher financing costs give equity-rich investors an advantage.

       "'\\n\\nParagraph 1: 2 Transaction volume down meaningfully Most pronounced reduction in activity is in Europe Year-over-year change in quarterly transaction volume But just as it was with COVID-19, the transition to a more stabilized state is uncertain and likely to have unexpected twists and turns. We have identified five global themes that we think investors should keep in mind as we move through the acute phase of monetary tightening toward a more stable global economy. G LO BA L In this ISA Outlook 2023, we look through the current acute period of volatility and uncertainty to discuss our view of likely outcomes and scenarios to consider, key themes for investing and real estate strategy recommendations that we expect to be resilient across the range of conceivable macro environments. Inflation should eventually settle closer to central banks target levels, allowing the longed-for pivot in interest rates. Bid-ask spreads in real estate capital markets will narrow, allowing activity to resume at an adjusted pricing level. The attraction of real estate as an asset class will endure, with variation around sectors, assets and geographies. G.4 Long-term inflation expectations remain subdued Inflation-protected yields anticipating a deceleration of inflation Breakeven rate between nominal and inflation-protected risk-free rates 200 150 100 50 0 -50 -100 transition to a living with COVID period. We have reached that milestone in most parts of the world. The virus is no longer a major constraint on life in many countries. While some things have not returned to the way they were pre- pandemic, that has been due to other factors, such as shifting preferences, not infection counts and restrictions. A year ago, key uncertainties surrounding our predictions for moving beyond the acute pandemic phase were around issues like new COVID variants and booster deployment. As for todays economic situation, key uncertainties include:  How long will it take for inflation to come under control? How high must interest rates go in the meantime? There have recently been signs that inflation is peaking, but such hopes could prove fleeting.; \\n\\nParagraph 2:  G LO BA L 2 The path of fundamentals will ultimately help determine where values settle Early in 2022, we framed the impact of rising inflation and interest rates on values as a race between debt costs and net operating income growth, as we anticipated that higher inflation would translate into higher rents in some sectors. Currently, it seems that debt costs are mostly winning the race. Ultimately, however, valuations are the result of the interaction between higher debt costs and the path of real estate fundamentals, the prospects for which vary widely across sectors and geographies. Tracing back real estate cash flows to their drivers is to follow a chain of causation back to basic variables like population, GDP, industrial production, consumer spending and employment. All of these interact with real estate factors, such as the balance of property supply and occupier demand, to influence property cash flows. Secular megatrends and structural features like legal and contractual constraints also matter. Going into 2023, there is increased uncertainty in many of these variables, especially the economic ones, given the pace of economic expansion is expected to be weaker or negative. This will have a cooling impact on property NOI growth, but nuances remain given that the transmission of macroeconomic conditions to real estate is a winding path. Starting with the underlying economic fundamentals, we are seeing a great deal of variation globally. In addition to the dimensions of depth and duration, a key uncertainty surrounding the coming downturn is how widespread it will be. Europe faces especially severe challenges stemming from an energy price shock, with ripple effects of unknown global scope. The dominant driver of inflation in the US, Canada and Singapore is that their economies are robust and operating close to full capacity. Demand- led inflation is relatively benign compared to inflation from a supply shock, but the central banks in these countries must still raise interest rates, either to manage their domestic economic situations or because their monetary policies are linked to the US Federal Reserve . Rising interest rates create clear risks to economic growth, with housing markets already being impacted by higher mortgage rates. Europes employment picture is also solid, but in addition to home-grown inflation, it is coping with a severe, energy-driven supply shock caused by the Russia-Ukraine war.; \\n\\nParagraph 3:  With the normalisation of monetary policy that has now begun, this situation should dissolve and the rise in real estate yields should be flatter than that of the risk-free interest rate. As a look at the early 1990s shows, prime real estate yields can even be below bond yields. Such a constellation presupposes high rental growth expectations. Given the current macro environment, we believe that investor expectations of rental growth are not sufficiently high for this in any sector. The logistics market and the less regulated part of the residential market might be an exception. But here, too, the uncertainty about further developments is likely to be too great, at least temporarily. Another relevant lower edge for property yields is financing costs. At the end of the third quarter of 2022, prime yields in all major market segments were below the cost of debt capital . This situation could only persist if the number of equity buyers is sufficiently large. Indeed, such investors are currently quite active and are taking advantage of the lower prices for purchases. However, we think it unlikely that the existing equity volume will be sufficient to anchor prices below the cost of financing. The fact that the increase in initial yields is nevertheless likely to be comparatively flat is also due to the mostly comfortable financing situation on the part of the landlords. Apart from the project development segment, we expect few forced sales. We rule out a wave of non-performing loans like after the financial crisis. Nevertheless, the steep rise in interest rates is likely to put individual landlords under stress, especially in the value-add and opportunistic segments, where financing durations are typically short. Lower demand for space and rents due to the recession could jeopardise the implementation of the business plan and thus also refinancing.; \\n\\nParagraph 4:  And while interest rates are increasing, equity and bond prices have been falling, triggering the denominator effect for some institutional investors with asset allocations that must remain in balance. The denominator effect can be magnified because CRE values in a portfolio are generally appraisal-based, which tend to be backward-looking. However, the impact on CRE portfolios may not be severe this time. Many institutional investors have been under-allocated in CRE, so they will not need to rebalance by selling real estate assets. Furthermore, a rising share of CRE investors is not gov- erned by fixed asset allocations, including public REITs, private investment firms, and high-net-worth individuals, and especially nontraded REITs, which have grown to be among the leading investors in CRE, with an asset value of almost $300 billion in 2021. In sum, capital availability should decline in the near term, though the denominator effect may not force sales as much as in typical downturns. Uncertainty Hesitancy Perhaps the biggest headwind to getting deals done now is uncertainty over where prices will settle. Reflecting the views of many experts we interviewed, one senior investment banker says, Transactions are being done at cap rates that are anywhere from 25 to 75 basis points wider than they werebut there is not any conviction that these are the right levels. That translates into a 5 to 15 percent drop in values so far, with more to come. But there are too few assets trading now to know for sure. Buyers are concerned about overpaying. Says one banker: Now is not the time to be a heromeaning, its not the time to go out and be aggressive on buying something. Its not the time to be aggressive on borrowing. On the other hand, sellers dont want to sell their assets short and then see them retraded at higher prices once the markets improve and few suffer from the financial distress that forces them to. It all translates into fewer deals. One senior adviser to institutional investors said, Its pen- cils down in investment committee. We cant get an acquisition or disposition approved in investment committee at this time. The fundamental issue for many investors is how long the Fed will keep raising rates.; \\n\\nParagraph 5:  An informed investor can bid decisively when attractive value opportunities emerge, even in out-of- favor sectors. Volatility can also create opportunities for investors across real estate quadrants and into capital stacks of assets. The return premiums and valuation gaps between private equity and public REITs or between South Reno Medical Center Reno, Nevada LOOKING AHEAD  Real estate pricing in North America will adjust to higher interest rates at varying speeds across sectors depending on the level of liquidity, strength of the ties to the fixed incomeequities markets and the motivation of sellers. For core real estate investors, a long-term view on interest rates is as important as the near-term trajectory of central bank policy rates.  Sectors with strong fundamentals entering an anticipated recession in 2023 are positioned to escape without sharp rent declines. There will be pockets of challenges where supply is particularly elevated. Beyond 2023, many markets should benefit from much lower new supply levels as new development is a much less attractive strategy than it was a year ago.  Shifting pricing will create opportunities for  Office investments in the US will face significant flexible investors. Pricing uncertainty can enable investors to achieve superior deal-specific value. Pricing gaps can also emerge between quadrants, with the rapid pricing changes in public equity and debt sometimes creating value and deal-specific elements creating value in private equity.  Denominator effects and higher borrowing costs will keep a meaningful fraction of core and higher return buyers on the sidelines, especially at the start of 2023. For well-capitalized buyers, this creates opportunities to deploy capital in a less competitive market and will allow investors to add strategic targets to diversified portfolios. challenges in 2023 as lenders and core buyers view the sector as particularly risky. Highly leveraged buyers with loans coming dueand in many cases their lenderswill face hard choices on how to proceed. In the US, transaction activity could become dominated by distressed sales later in 2023. In Canada, distressed sales will be less likely given the higher concentration of institutional ownership in the office market, much of which is unlevered.; \\n\\nParagraph 6:  10 Exhibit 1-6 Availability of Capital for Real Estate, 2023 versus 2022 2023 2022 Lending source Nonbank nancial institutions Debt funds Government-sponsored enterprises Insurance companies Mortgage REITs Commercial banks Securitized lendersCMBS Equity source Private-equityopportunity hedge funds Foreign investors Private REITs Private local investors Institutional investors pension funds Public-equity REITs 3.05 3.44 2.99 3.26 2.97 3.39 2.83 3.44 2.72 3.42 2.58 3.63 2.56 3.61 3.18 3.74 3.09 3.54 3.00 3.59 2.98 3.66 2.89 3.67 2.73 3.40 2023 2022 1 2 Large decline 3 Stay the same 4 5 Large increase Source: Emerging Trends in Real Estate surveys. Note: Based on U. S. respondents only. Says the regional leader of one global firm, Cap rates have gapped out as interest rates went up. And suddenly, things didnt pencil, and that generated broken deals. The cost of financing for real estate and everything else went up dramatically. And so everything has to be repriced, everything has to be reset. Also limiting investor demand: debt is getting more difficult to obtain, and the Emerging Trends survey expects underwriting standards to get even more rigorous. As the partner in one lead- ing advisory firm explains, This is one of those cash is king situations where borrowing costs are higher, and if youre an all- cash buyer, those probably represent a disproportionate share of the people in the market today. Meanwhile, the same interest rate increases that reduce lever- aged returns and thus demand for real estate also make bonds and other interest-bearing investments more compelling. As the head of real estate banking at one investment bank explains, Rising bond yields are going to mean that real estate and other alternatives are all going to be facing less availability of capital and some outflows.; \\n\\nParagraph 7: 5 Spiking rates drive rapid tightening of financial conditions Cost of capital rising sharply in most geographies Nominal corporate bond yields 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 7 0 n a J 8 0 n a J 9 0 n a J 0 1 n a J 1 1 n a J 2 1 n a J 3 1 n a J 4 1 n a J 5 1 n a J 6 1 n a J 7 1 n a J 8 1 n a J 9 1 n a J 0 2 n a J 1 2 n a J 2 2 n a J US C. Europe Singapore Japan United Kingdom Australia Canada Source: Bloomberg. As of November 30, 2022. LOOKING AHEAD  The relentless math of higher interest rates will continue to weigh heavily on real estate values, at least until interest rates stabilize as inflation begins to subside. The bid- ask spread for private real estate should eventually close and transactions will resume in earnest at a rebased level.  In the meantime, investment styles that are less sensitive to volatility in values should be contemplated, such as floating-rate lending with a comfortable cushion from lower loan-to-value ratios. Debt investment can be attractive at times of uncertainty, as investors tilt toward contractually certain income and away from an uncertain upside. Portfolio aggregation strategies with smaller asset sizes that lend themselves to averaging-in with diversified timing of entry points represent another way to cope with volatile and uncertain values.  The inputs to the math are not changing to the same degree in every part of the world. Wherever rate spikes are less intense, or the prospects for rental growth are clearest, transaction activity and prices have been less impacted.  In addition to debt costs, investors should also consider the trajectory of cash flows, which depend on economic fundamentals and real estate occupier market conditions. The differential prospects for real estate cash flows are the subject of the next section.'"

       "     'text': ' One reason: existing tax laws are stacked against the individual homebuyer. Explains one academic, Investors are allowed to not only deduct everything, but also they can depreciate the unit. They also have access to lower cost of capital. In sum, institutional buyers assembling horizontal apartment portfolios can afford to pay more to be the high bidder for homes. And they do. Investors account for one in five homebuyers, up by a third compared with before the pandemic. Another supply constraint is homebuilders cautious construc- tion pacing, a vestige of the last recession. Explains the director of an investment institute who developed housing earlier in his career, A lot of the homebuilders, when the Great Recession happened, were stuck with inventory, said, Were not doing that again. Were going to build 10 new units, and as they sell, well start the next one, etc. And then labor shortages are compounding the problems. The construction sector as a whole hasnt returned to the peak we saw prior to the Great Recession. We saw a lot of that labor leave the sector for something maybe perceived more stable, says the economist for a housing advisory firm. All these factors are conspiring to limit housing construction far below population growth. In fact, the number of single-family housing starts in the last decade (20102019) relative to house- hold formations was the lowest since the government began tracking these trends and half as much or less than in preced- ing decades, despite the consistent increase in deliveries since bottoming in 2010. And now both permits and housing starts have been trending down again in 2022.

       "     'text': '  Two, demand gathered speed and sweep as people sought larger living spaces to balance remote work and household life, and more outdoor living options.  Three, constrained construction of new supply, and a price run-up on the single-family for-sale front, spilled over into expanded apartment demand.  Lastly, compounding the effects of these four dramatic imbalances came the rocket fuel of a global capital rotation toward de-risked assets . Outsized demand, a sudden spike in remote work mobility, constricted supply, and floods of money with nowhere better to goa grand slam of anomalies. The U. S. apartment property sectorproviding shelter to 37 mil- lion residents in 21.3 million structures of five or more household units, and contributing $3.4 trillion annually to the U. S. economy, according to the NMHCmorphed quickly into an investment asset class pressure cooker. Inflated property valuations, com- pressed cap rates, and a sea change from individual owners to medium and large-sized corporate owners became a new norm seemingly overnight. This time period veers wildly from a steady slope of otherwise well-entrenched trends across the structural demand front. Operational modernization kicked into super-fast-forward mode toward self-service, and a robust new-development pipeline at least. According to a recent Bloomberg report, After dipping in 2020, the number of new units authorized in multifamily build- ings took off, running 37 percent higher over the past 12 months as of June 2022 than in the same period in 20182019. As of August, 862,000 apartments were under construction, up 25 percent from a year ago. At the same time, COVIDs aftermath sharply defined conflicting forceswhich together destine virtually all of Americas newly developed and built apartment communities for a financially privileged professional class. Rather than causing an expansion of rental housing stock, however, higher-income households come-lately demand for rental neighborhoods instead served to crowd out moderate- and lower-income households in supply- constrained areas. Its been virtually impossible to build affordable, says the chief executive of one of the apartment industry trade groups.',\n",

The increase in costs in 2018 and 2019 was considerably higher, but since 2021, it has been unprecedented: Construction costs rose by around 9 per cent in 2021 and, in the first half of 2022, they rose by almost 16 per cent! The cost of reno- vation has risen on a similar scale.',\n",

And the homes that do get built are expensive, particularly since the pandemic. Construction costs shot up due to supply chain disruptions and are still worrisome. As one housing industry adviser notes, Theres a stress index about global supply chains, and those stress indices are all indicating that theyre moderating, but theyre still at very high levels. Finally, high permitting fees and utility charges and large minimum lot sizes push developers to build more expensive homes. Renters Priced Out of the Homebuying Market With a growing share of households priced out of the for-sale market, demand for rental units is far outstripping new supply. Though population growth slowed sharply during the pandemic, demand is also rising from the many young adults eager to start their own households after moving back in with their parents during COVID. Further boosting demand is the increasing number of younger adults choosing to live alone, according The multifamily sector has responded with an unprecedented increase in new supply. Weve built more multifamily housing units over the last 10 years than we had in any other time since 1980, notes an adviser to institutional investors. But it is still far less than needed. Vacancies have fallen to their lowest levels ever while rents are rising faster than evereven faster than home prices. And though not a formal part of the affordability calculations, other housing-related costs like utilities and main- tenance are also rising faster than incomes, further constraining the ability of households to afford basic shelter. Moving to More Affordable Recent slowdowns in rent growth and home price appreciation, noted in our Normalizing trend, have done little to increase affordability. So how to address this? Millions of people have taken matters into their own hands.',\n",

After more than a decade of lower for longer, the Fed is finally normalizing interest rates closer to historical levels. Those rising interest rates are already driving up debt costs and thus the costs to acquire and develop property, reducing leveraged returns.

Thus, the government is turning off both the monetary and fiscal spigots that had been support- ing commercial real estate and the economy overall.

In addition, we analyze how opportunistic and value-add managers will need to adopt their strategies now that interest rates are higher, and how their ability to generate out-size returns simply by adding leverage is gone. So, a number of important topics for us and investors to consider. We hope you find our answers insightful and useful in determining your strategy and thinking about some of the key questions in real estate as we move into the new year. Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy. Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs. We have already started to see cap rates and yields rise in many markets, with the most rapid adjustment taking place in the UK. However, we do not think that prices fully reflect higher interest rates yet. To assess when values might bottom out, we can look to past downturns and the listed market for guidance. In the Global Financial Crisis, for example, global capital values bottomed out in 4Q09, while GDP across global real estate markets troughed three quarters earlier, in 1Q09, as did global listed real estate prices1. Market downturns usually present opportunities, and one we expect for investors in 2023 is a correction in pricing as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. Although we do not expect large amounts of distress in the market, we do expect some, already apparent in parts of the UK market. This should allow investors access to assets at attractive pricing. The early 1990s downturn was longer, with US capital values continuing to decline into 1995. We expect modest declines in GDP in the first half of 2023 before growth resumes.',\n",

Australia is cementing its status as a safe haven in the region. Singapores relative attractiveness to Hong Kong is expec- ted to increase. Higher interest rates are less of a concern in Japan where the spread between the risk-free rate and real estate yields remains stable. A zero-Covid-19 policy, a troubled property sector and geopolitical tensions have led to a risk premium for China. Asia Pacific Macro-economic trends The Asia-Pacific region is expected to grow faster during 2023- 2025 compared with the U. S. or EU with a lower risk of recession. Within the region, and for the first time in decades, it is expected that Australia and Singapore will record higher quarterly GDP growth figures in Q3 and Q4 2022 than China.

LOOKING AHEAD  The relentless math of higher interest rates will continue to weigh heavily on real estate values, at least until interest rates stabilize as inflation begins to subside. The bid- ask spread for private real estate should eventually close and transactions will resume in earnest at a rebased level.  In the meantime, investment styles that are less sensitive to volatility in values should be contemplated, such as floating-rate lending with a comfortable cushion from lower loan-to-value ratios. Debt investment can be attractive at times of uncertainty, as investors tilt toward contractually certain income and away from an uncertain upside. Portfolio aggregation strategies with smaller asset sizes that lend themselves to averaging-in with diversified timing of entry points represent another way to cope with volatile and uncertain values.  The inputs to the math are not changing to the same degree in every part of the world. Wherever rate spikes are less intense, or the prospects for rental growth are clearest, transaction activity and prices have been less impacted.  In addition to debt costs, investors should also consider the trajectory of cash flows, which depend on economic fundamentals and real estate occupier market conditions. The differential prospects for real estate cash flows are the subject of the next section.',\n",

The denominator effect can be magnified because CRE values in a portfolio are generally appraisal-based, which tend to be backward-looking. However, the impact on CRE portfolios may not be severe this time. Many institutional investors have been under-allocated in CRE, so they will not need to rebalance by selling real estate assets. Furthermore, a rising share of CRE investors is not gov- erned by fixed asset allocations, including public REITs, private investment firms, and high-net-worth individuals, and especially nontraded REITs, which have grown to be among the leading investors in CRE, with an asset value of almost $300 billion in 2021. In sum, capital availability should decline in the near term, though the denominator effect may not force sales as much as in typical downturns. Uncertainty Hesitancy Perhaps the biggest headwind to getting deals done now is uncertainty over where prices will settle. Reflecting the views of many experts we interviewed, one senior investment banker says, Transactions are being done at cap rates that are anywhere from 25 to 75 basis points wider than they werebut there is not any conviction that these are the right levels. That translates into a 5 to 15 percent drop in values so far, with more to come. But there are too few assets trading now to know for sure. Buyers are concerned about overpaying. Says one banker: Now is not the time to be a heromeaning, its not the time to go out and be aggressive on buying something. Its not the time to be aggressive on borrowing. On the other hand, sellers dont want to sell their assets short and then see them retraded at higher prices once the markets improve and few suffer from the financial distress that forces them to. It all translates into fewer deals. One senior adviser to institutional investors said, Its pen- cils down in investment committee. We cant get an acquisition or disposition approved in investment committee at this time. The fundamental issue for many investors is how long the Fed will keep raising rates.',\n",

Currently, it seems that debt costs are mostly winning the race. Ultimately, however, valuations are the result of the interaction between higher debt costs and the path of real estate fundamentals, the prospects for which vary widely across sectors and geographies. Tracing back real estate cash flows to their drivers is to follow a chain of causation back to basic variables like population, GDP, industrial production, consumer spending and employment.

The dominant driver of inflation in the US, Canada and Singapore is that their economies are robust and operating close to full capacity. Demand- led inflation is relatively benign compared to inflation from a supply shock, but the central banks in these countries must still raise interest rates, either to manage their domestic economic situations or because their monetary policies are linked to the US Federal Reserve .

Furthermore, a rising share of CRE investors is not gov- erned by fixed asset allocations, including public REITs, private investment firms, and high-net-worth individuals, and especially nontraded REITs, which have grown to be among the leading investors in CRE, with an asset value of almost $300 billion in 2021. In sum, capital availability should decline in the near term, though the denominator effect may not force sales as much as in typical downturns. Uncertainty Hesitancy Perhaps the biggest headwind to getting deals done now is uncertainty over where prices will settle. Reflecting the views of many experts we interviewed, one senior investment banker says, Transactions are being done at cap rates that are anywhere from 25 to 75 basis points wider than they werebut there is not any conviction that these are the right levels. That translates into a 5 to 15 percent drop in values so far, with more to come. But there are too few assets trading now to know for sure. Buyers are concerned about overpaying. Says one banker: Now is not the time to be a heromeaning, its not the time to go out and be aggressive on buying something. Its not the time to be aggressive on borrowing. On the other hand, sellers dont want to sell their assets short and then see them retraded at higher prices once the markets improve and few suffer from the financial distress that forces them to. It all translates into fewer deals. One senior adviser to institutional investors said, Its pen- cils down in investment committee. We cant get an acquisition or disposition approved in investment committee at this time. The fundamental issue for many investors is how long the Fed will keep raising rates.',\n",

Europe Singapore Japan United Kingdom Australia Canada Source: Bloomberg. As of November 30, 2022. LOOKING AHEAD  The relentless math of higher interest rates will continue to weigh heavily on real estate values, at least until interest rates stabilize as inflation begins to subside. The bid- ask spread for private real estate should eventually close and transactions will resume in earnest at a rebased level.  In the meantime, investment styles that are less sensitive to volatility in values should be contemplated, such as floating-rate lending with a comfortable cushion from lower loan-to-value ratios. Debt investment can be attractive at times of uncertainty, as investors tilt toward contractually certain income and away from an uncertain upside. Portfolio aggregation strategies with smaller asset sizes that lend themselves to averaging-in with diversified timing of entry points represent another way to cope with volatile and uncertain values.  The inputs to the math are not changing to the same degree in every part of the world. Wherever rate spikes are less intense, or the prospects for rental growth are clearest, transaction activity and prices have been less impacted.  In addition to debt costs, investors should also consider the trajectory of cash flows, which depend on economic fundamentals and real estate occupier market conditions. The differential prospects for real estate cash flows are the subject of the next section.',\n",

       "     'text': ' G LO BA L 2 The path of fundamentals will ultimately help determine where values settle Early in 2022, we framed the impact of rising inflation and interest rates on values as a race between debt costs and net operating income growth, as we anticipated that higher inflation would translate into higher rents in some sectors. Currently, it seems that debt costs are mostly winning the race. Ultimately, however, valuations are the result of the interaction between higher debt costs and the path of real estate fundamentals, the prospects for which vary widely across sectors and geographies. Tracing back real estate cash flows to their drivers is to follow a chain of causation back to basic variables like population, GDP, industrial production, consumer spending and employment. All of these interact with real estate factors, such as the balance of property supply and occupier demand, to influence property cash flows. Secular megatrends and structural features like legal and contractual constraints also matter. Going into 2023, there is increased uncertainty in many of these variables, especially the economic ones, given the pace of economic expansion is expected to be weaker or negative. This will have a cooling impact on property NOI growth, but nuances remain given that the transmission of macroeconomic conditions to real estate is a winding path. Starting with the underlying economic fundamentals, we are seeing a great deal of variation globally. In addition to the dimensions of depth and duration, a key uncertainty surrounding the coming downturn is how widespread it will be. Europe faces especially severe challenges stemming from an energy price shock, with ripple effects of unknown global scope. The dominant driver of inflation in the US, Canada and Singapore is that their economies are robust and operating close to full capacity. Demand- led inflation is relatively benign compared to inflation from a supply shock, but the central banks in these countries must still raise interest rates, either to manage their domestic economic situations or because their monetary policies are linked to the US Federal Reserve . Rising interest rates create clear risks to economic growth, with housing markets already being impacted by higher mortgage rates. Europes employment picture is also solid, but in addition to home-grown inflation, it is coping with a severe, energy-driven supply shock caused by the Russia-Ukraine war.',\n",

       "     'text': ' Broker reports indicate that prime yields already started to move out in some locations between Q1 2022 and Q2 2022, with German cities leading the pack at 30bps. French and Spanish cities posted quarter-on-quarter yield increases of between 15 and 25bps. As risk-free rates are up and expected to remain elevated between 2023 and 2025, we believe office capital values could soften further during the outlook period, and we estimate prime yields in Europe will move out by another 50bps. This would amount to a value loss of around 10 to 15 before stabilization and recovery takes place. Office transaction volumes in Europe already fell by over 20 during Q2 2022 compared with the same year-earlier period. Bouwinvest Outlook 2023-2025 9 Europe Logistics Covid-19 had a surprisingly positive effect on European logistics markets with the accelerated adoption of online shopping more than offsetting the economic turmoil. Now that the pandemic appears to be largely under control, the pace of e-commerce growth has eased, but is still positive and the potential for further expansion remains strong as consumers service expectations continue to evolve and drive demand for logistics properties. reluctance among municipalities to issue land for new logistic space. We expect this latter trend to continue in the coming years, with Germany and France currently showing the most resistance to new greenfield developments. As a result, nominal rental growth, although slowing down, is expected to remain positive during the outlook period at a figure just shy of 3.0 per annum. Global supply chain disruption following the pandemic and ongoing geopolitical tensions are also fuelling a supply chain reconfiguration with a greater emphasis on onshoring over just-in-time. This is boosting domestic demand for logistics real estate and helping to ease wider supply chain pressures. European economic support programmes running until 2027 and totalling 1.1 trillion are expected to provide another boost to the sector. The volume of new supply coming to market is meanwhile decreasing due to both rising construction costs and a Capital values of prime logistics properties are forecast to decline by an average 7-8 in Q4 2022 compared with Q4 2021 levels.',\n",

Office values will fall more than other property sectors such as multifamily in which rising rents counterbalance higher cap rates. Plus, debt is becoming more constrained as lenders and bond investors are wary of the potential for increased risk of default if office tenants downsize. There is uncertainty in the cost and access to debt finance for office, noted one executive. The Emerging Trends survey confirmed that industry partici- pants are conflicted about pricing, favoring niche sectors such as medical office, and expecting that suburban offices will retain value better than center city offices. Conversions to Rise, but . . As tenants eschew older, lower-quality stock, that means that more office buildings are candidates for conversion. Obsolete 62 office buildings around the country are being converted to multifamily, industrial, medical offices, life sciences, and other uses. States such as New York and New Jersey are exploring legislation to ease the entitlement process around conversions. It makes perfect sense in Manhattan, where the office vacancy rate has shot up in Midtown as tenants chase new buildings in Hudson Yards and housing is in critically short supply. For example, New York developers Silverstein Properties and Macklowe Properties are converting office towers to apartments, and Hines is converting a tower in Salt Lake City. Even so, conversions remain sporadic relative to the new constructionnearly 150 million square feet of office space is under construction nationally, per Yardi Matrixdue to logistics. Conversions are costly and the stars need to be aligned with the right building configuration, floor plates, neighborhood ameni- ties, and demand, not to mention considerations such as tax structure. Each conversion stands on its own. Notes Moodys Analytics: The office-to-apartment conversion trend will likely be a minor one, unless office values and rents see some major, permanent decline after the pandemic. Finding an obsolete office building at the right price and asking rents, with high vacancy and the right floor plates to convert into an apartment building is great in theory, but hard to execute in todays market.',\n",

       "     'text': ' New home prices peaked in April 2022, while prices of existing homes likely peaked in June after appreciation started to slow with the rise in mortgage rates. Meanwhile, apartment rents have continued to push ever higher, but the pace has been moderating in recent months. Construction starts also have slowed. The National Association of Home Builders housing market index has fallen for eight straight months through August 2022 to its lowest level since May 2020. This is not to say that were in a housing recessionfar from it. Homes are still selling at a healthy rate by historical levels, and home prices remain near record levels. And while multifamily vacancies are at their lowest level in four decades and rents continue to log new records every month, the rates of increase have been slowing and are expected to decelerate further, according to many experts we interviewed. Maybe you dont see the 10 percentplus rent growth in multifamily markets, says the head of one institutional investment advisory firm. They should come back to more of a long-term historical average of 3 percent to 4 percent, and maybe offset some of the unafford- ability in the country. Indeed, housing markets may be partly victims of their own success as record prices and rents mean fewer households can afford to buy homes or rent apartments, particularly with mort- gage interest rates and housing-related expenses like utilities 6 rising sharplya topic we explore in Too Much for Too Many, our trend on housing affordability. The Amazon Pause The white-hot industrial market also seems set to cool after sev- eral years of unprecedented demand growth and rent gains that have pushed rents far above prior records. Growth in e-com- merce is slowing and giving back some of the market share it captured from physical retailers during the pandemic. Amazon, the largest warehouse user in the United States, has delayed occupying numerous completed projects, trying to sublet many, as it slows its physical growthwhat some are calling the Amazon pause. Other major retailers also have been cutting back their distribution expansion plans. To be sure, the industrial sector still enjoys record-low vacancy rates, as demand for high-quality, well-located logistics facilities has been running ahead of the markets ability to supply them.',\n",

In mid-2022, yet another freshly drawn inflection pointcoin- ciding with the devastation wrought by the Russia-Ukraine war and an aggressive U. S. monetary and fiscal tightening effort to dial down inflationquickly spread the pain of a cost-of-living crisis across Americas households. In addition, it casts a new cloud of uncertainty over the near-term outlook for market-rate residential investment. The Push and Pull of Trends: Rentership Rising Broad-stroke household demographics point irrefutably to strong secular demand for multifamily rental apartment development. During the 2022-to-2035 stretch that lies ahead, 275 million adults the total of all the adult-aged generational cohortswill continue to make shelter decisions, especially as U. S. domes- tic migration and mobility continues at over 27 million movers each year. Financial factorsgiven that runaway costs and high mortgage interest rates will price more households out of homeownership as an optionwill determine many of their decisions, as has long been the case. What is different over the past several years has been growth in discretionary rental households, also known as rent-by-choice households. According to Harvards Joint Center for Housing Studies (JCHS), the number of renters making at least $75,000 jumped by 48 percent over the decade ending just before the pandemic, to 11.3 million. With this increase, the share of renter households in this income group rose from 20 percent to 26 percent. Younger, older, and more economically, racially, and culturally diverse households together will bend the economic and cultural arc of rentership upward. Apartment industry leaders now recognize a blurring of behav- ioral lines across generations. When it comes to housing type need or preference, generational cohortsgeneration Z, millen- nials, generation X, and empty-nester baby boomersact more like each other than not.',\n",
