       "' A catchment area of 2.4 million potential customers and a large volume of day-trippers from the Benelux countries are an at- tractive prospect for retailers. However, tourism was not quite as important before Covid as in other top locations. Spending power is also moderate for a top location at 104 points. Unlike Dsseldorf with its distinctive luxury segment, Cologne city centre is focused on lower-end retail. A three kilometre shopping circuit encourages a stroll through prime locations and boosts footfall. One particular example is Schildergasse, the location for many chain store branches. Footfall is also high in Hohe Strae, but below the high levels of Schildergasse. Conversely, Ehrenstrae is a trendy location. A smaller luxury segment has become established in the DomklosterWallrafplatz area. The consequences of the pandemic have clearly had an impact on Cologne ci- ty centre. Between 2019 and the end of 2021 prime rents fell by 12 per cent to EUR 225 per m2, a level which has since been maintained. The rate of decline is on a par with the trend in the top locations, and the relatively large supply of sales space in Cologne city centre has not therefore had any further negative impact on the rent trend. No new information is available on plans announced in spring 2022 to demo- lish the building where the Galeria branch is located in Breiten Strae.

      "[Text]:  This is understandable from the sellers perspective, since the modest in- crease in rental yields from their previously low levels has led to visibly low purchase prices. We expect the buyers and sellers sides to converge in the months ahead, causing investment volume to pick up again. Given that bond yields remain low, real estate remains an alternative worth considering, especially as the inflation-indexed commercial leases lead to rising rental income, which has a positive impact on achievable yields and thus also on purchase prices. The higher financing costs give equity-rich investors an advantage.

       "'\\n\\nParagraph 1: 2 Transaction volume down meaningfully Most pronounced reduction in activity is in Europe Year-over-year change in quarterly transaction volume But just as it was with COVID-19, the transition to a more stabilized state is uncertain and likely to have unexpected twists and turns. We have identified five global themes that we think investors should keep in mind as we move through the acute phase of monetary tightening toward a more stable global economy. G LO BA L In this ISA Outlook 2023, we look through the current acute period of volatility and uncertainty to discuss our view of likely outcomes and scenarios to consider, key themes for investing and real estate strategy recommendations that we expect to be resilient across the range of conceivable macro environments. Inflation should eventually settle closer to central banks target levels, allowing the longed-for pivot in interest rates. Bid-ask spreads in real estate capital markets will narrow, allowing activity to resume at an adjusted pricing level. The attraction of real estate as an asset class will endure, with variation around sectors, assets and geographies. G.4 Long-term inflation expectations remain subdued Inflation-protected yields anticipating a deceleration of inflation Breakeven rate between nominal and inflation-protected risk-free rates 200 150 100 50 0 -50 -100 transition to a living with COVID period. We have reached that milestone in most parts of the world. The virus is no longer a major constraint on life in many countries. While some things have not returned to the way they were pre- pandemic, that has been due to other factors, such as shifting preferences, not infection counts and restrictions. A year ago, key uncertainties surrounding our predictions for moving beyond the acute pandemic phase were around issues like new COVID variants and booster deployment. As for todays economic situation, key uncertainties include:  How long will it take for inflation to come under control? How high must interest rates go in the meantime? There have recently been signs that inflation is peaking, but such hopes could prove fleeting.; \\n\\nParagraph 2:  G LO BA L 2 The path of fundamentals will ultimately help determine where values settle Early in 2022, we framed the impact of rising inflation and interest rates on values as a race between debt costs and net operating income growth, as we anticipated that higher inflation would translate into higher rents in some sectors. Currently, it seems that debt costs are mostly winning the race. Ultimately, however, valuations are the result of the interaction between higher debt costs and the path of real estate fundamentals, the prospects for which vary widely across sectors and geographies. Tracing back real estate cash flows to their drivers is to follow a chain of causation back to basic variables like population, GDP, industrial production, consumer spending and employment. All of these interact with real estate factors, such as the balance of property supply and occupier demand, to influence property cash flows. Secular megatrends and structural features like legal and contractual constraints also matter. Going into 2023, there is increased uncertainty in many of these variables, especially the economic ones, given the pace of economic expansion is expected to be weaker or negative. This will have a cooling impact on property NOI growth, but nuances remain given that the transmission of macroeconomic conditions to real estate is a winding path. Starting with the underlying economic fundamentals, we are seeing a great deal of variation globally. In addition to the dimensions of depth and duration, a key uncertainty surrounding the coming downturn is how widespread it will be. Europe faces especially severe challenges stemming from an energy price shock, with ripple effects of unknown global scope. The dominant driver of inflation in the US, Canada and Singapore is that their economies are robust and operating close to full capacity. Demand- led inflation is relatively benign compared to inflation from a supply shock, but the central banks in these countries must still raise interest rates, either to manage their domestic economic situations or because their monetary policies are linked to the US Federal Reserve . Rising interest rates create clear risks to economic growth, with housing markets already being impacted by higher mortgage rates. Europes employment picture is also solid, but in addition to home-grown inflation, it is coping with a severe, energy-driven supply shock caused by the Russia-Ukraine war.; \\n\\nParagraph 3:  With the normalisation of monetary policy that has now begun, this situation should dissolve and the rise in real estate yields should be flatter than that of the risk-free interest rate. As a look at the early 1990s shows, prime real estate yields can even be below bond yields. Such a constellation presupposes high rental growth expectations. Given the current macro environment, we believe that investor expectations of rental growth are not sufficiently high for this in any sector. The logistics market and the less regulated part of the residential market might be an exception. But here, too, the uncertainty about further developments is likely to be too great, at least temporarily. Another relevant lower edge for property yields is financing costs. At the end of the third quarter of 2022, prime yields in all major market segments were below the cost of debt capital . This situation could only persist if the number of equity buyers is sufficiently large. Indeed, such investors are currently quite active and are taking advantage of the lower prices for purchases. However, we think it unlikely that the existing equity volume will be sufficient to anchor prices below the cost of financing. The fact that the increase in initial yields is nevertheless likely to be comparatively flat is also due to the mostly comfortable financing situation on the part of the landlords. Apart from the project development segment, we expect few forced sales. We rule out a wave of non-performing loans like after the financial crisis. Nevertheless, the steep rise in interest rates is likely to put individual landlords under stress, especially in the value-add and opportunistic segments, where financing durations are typically short. Lower demand for space and rents due to the recession could jeopardise the implementation of the business plan and thus also refinancing.; \\n\\nParagraph 4:  And while interest rates are increasing, equity and bond prices have been falling, triggering the denominator effect for some institutional investors with asset allocations that must remain in balance. The denominator effect can be magnified because CRE values in a portfolio are generally appraisal-based, which tend to be backward-looking. However, the impact on CRE portfolios may not be severe this time. Many institutional investors have been under-allocated in CRE, so they will not need to rebalance by selling real estate assets. Furthermore, a rising share of CRE investors is not gov- erned by fixed asset allocations, including public REITs, private investment firms, and high-net-worth individuals, and especially nontraded REITs, which have grown to be among the leading investors in CRE, with an asset value of almost $300 billion in 2021. In sum, capital availability should decline in the near term, though the denominator effect may not force sales as much as in typical downturns. Uncertainty Hesitancy Perhaps the biggest headwind to getting deals done now is uncertainty over where prices will settle. Reflecting the views of many experts we interviewed, one senior investment banker says, Transactions are being done at cap rates that are anywhere from 25 to 75 basis points wider than they werebut there is not any conviction that these are the right levels. That translates into a 5 to 15 percent drop in values so far, with more to come. But there are too few assets trading now to know for sure. Buyers are concerned about overpaying. Says one banker: Now is not the time to be a heromeaning, its not the time to go out and be aggressive on buying something. Its not the time to be aggressive on borrowing. On the other hand, sellers dont want to sell their assets short and then see them retraded at higher prices once the markets improve and few suffer from the financial distress that forces them to. It all translates into fewer deals. One senior adviser to institutional investors said, Its pen- cils down in investment committee. We cant get an acquisition or disposition approved in investment committee at this time. The fundamental issue for many investors is how long the Fed will keep raising rates.; \\n\\nParagraph 5:  An informed investor can bid decisively when attractive value opportunities emerge, even in out-of- favor sectors. Volatility can also create opportunities for investors across real estate quadrants and into capital stacks of assets. The return premiums and valuation gaps between private equity and public REITs or between South Reno Medical Center Reno, Nevada LOOKING AHEAD  Real estate pricing in North America will adjust to higher interest rates at varying speeds across sectors depending on the level of liquidity, strength of the ties to the fixed incomeequities markets and the motivation of sellers. For core real estate investors, a long-term view on interest rates is as important as the near-term trajectory of central bank policy rates.  Sectors with strong fundamentals entering an anticipated recession in 2023 are positioned to escape without sharp rent declines. There will be pockets of challenges where supply is particularly elevated. Beyond 2023, many markets should benefit from much lower new supply levels as new development is a much less attractive strategy than it was a year ago.  Shifting pricing will create opportunities for  Office investments in the US will face significant flexible investors. Pricing uncertainty can enable investors to achieve superior deal-specific value. Pricing gaps can also emerge between quadrants, with the rapid pricing changes in public equity and debt sometimes creating value and deal-specific elements creating value in private equity.  Denominator effects and higher borrowing costs will keep a meaningful fraction of core and higher return buyers on the sidelines, especially at the start of 2023. For well-capitalized buyers, this creates opportunities to deploy capital in a less competitive market and will allow investors to add strategic targets to diversified portfolios. challenges in 2023 as lenders and core buyers view the sector as particularly risky. Highly leveraged buyers with loans coming dueand in many cases their lenderswill face hard choices on how to proceed. In the US, transaction activity could become dominated by distressed sales later in 2023. In Canada, distressed sales will be less likely given the higher concentration of institutional ownership in the office market, much of which is unlevered.; \\n\\nParagraph 6:  10 Exhibit 1-6 Availability of Capital for Real Estate, 2023 versus 2022 2023 2022 Lending source Nonbank nancial institutions Debt funds Government-sponsored enterprises Insurance companies Mortgage REITs Commercial banks Securitized lendersCMBS Equity source Private-equityopportunity hedge funds Foreign investors Private REITs Private local investors Institutional investors pension funds Public-equity REITs 3.05 3.44 2.99 3.26 2.97 3.39 2.83 3.44 2.72 3.42 2.58 3.63 2.56 3.61 3.18 3.74 3.09 3.54 3.00 3.59 2.98 3.66 2.89 3.67 2.73 3.40 2023 2022 1 2 Large decline 3 Stay the same 4 5 Large increase Source: Emerging Trends in Real Estate surveys. Note: Based on U. S. respondents only. Says the regional leader of one global firm, Cap rates have gapped out as interest rates went up. And suddenly, things didnt pencil, and that generated broken deals. The cost of financing for real estate and everything else went up dramatically. And so everything has to be repriced, everything has to be reset. Also limiting investor demand: debt is getting more difficult to obtain, and the Emerging Trends survey expects underwriting standards to get even more rigorous. As the partner in one lead- ing advisory firm explains, This is one of those cash is king situations where borrowing costs are higher, and if youre an all- cash buyer, those probably represent a disproportionate share of the people in the market today. Meanwhile, the same interest rate increases that reduce lever- aged returns and thus demand for real estate also make bonds and other interest-bearing investments more compelling. As the head of real estate banking at one investment bank explains, Rising bond yields are going to mean that real estate and other alternatives are all going to be facing less availability of capital and some outflows.; \\n\\nParagraph 7: 5 Spiking rates drive rapid tightening of financial conditions Cost of capital rising sharply in most geographies Nominal corporate bond yields 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 7 0 n a J 8 0 n a J 9 0 n a J 0 1 n a J 1 1 n a J 2 1 n a J 3 1 n a J 4 1 n a J 5 1 n a J 6 1 n a J 7 1 n a J 8 1 n a J 9 1 n a J 0 2 n a J 1 2 n a J 2 2 n a J US C. Europe Singapore Japan United Kingdom Australia Canada Source: Bloomberg. As of November 30, 2022. LOOKING AHEAD  The relentless math of higher interest rates will continue to weigh heavily on real estate values, at least until interest rates stabilize as inflation begins to subside. The bid- ask spread for private real estate should eventually close and transactions will resume in earnest at a rebased level.  In the meantime, investment styles that are less sensitive to volatility in values should be contemplated, such as floating-rate lending with a comfortable cushion from lower loan-to-value ratios. Debt investment can be attractive at times of uncertainty, as investors tilt toward contractually certain income and away from an uncertain upside. Portfolio aggregation strategies with smaller asset sizes that lend themselves to averaging-in with diversified timing of entry points represent another way to cope with volatile and uncertain values.  The inputs to the math are not changing to the same degree in every part of the world. Wherever rate spikes are less intense, or the prospects for rental growth are clearest, transaction activity and prices have been less impacted.  In addition to debt costs, investors should also consider the trajectory of cash flows, which depend on economic fundamentals and real estate occupier market conditions. The differential prospects for real estate cash flows are the subject of the next section.'"

       "     'text': ' We also dive into student housing in the US, another sector booming among investors, and what impact demographic trends might have on it. In addition, we analyze how opportunistic and value-add managers will need to adopt their strategies now that interest rates are higher, and how their ability to generate out-size returns simply by adding leverage is gone. So, a number of important topics for us and investors to consider. We hope you find our answers insightful and useful in determining your strategy and thinking about some of the key questions in real estate as we move into the new year. Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy. Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs. We have already started to see cap rates and yields rise in many markets, with the most rapid adjustment taking place in the UK. However, we do not think that prices fully reflect higher interest rates yet. To assess when values might bottom out, we can look to past downturns and the listed market for guidance. In the Global Financial Crisis, for example, global capital values bottomed out in 4Q09, while GDP across global real estate markets troughed three quarters earlier, in 1Q09, as did global listed real estate prices1. Market downturns usually present opportunities, and one we expect for investors in 2023 is a correction in pricing as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. Although we do not expect large amounts of distress in the market, we do expect some, already apparent in parts of the UK market. This should allow investors access to assets at attractive pricing. The early 1990s downturn was longer, with US capital values continuing to decline into 1995. We expect modest declines in GDP in the first half of 2023 before growth resumes.',\n",

       "     'text': ' We also dive into student housing in the US, another sector booming among investors, and what impact demographic trends might have on it. In addition, we analyze how opportunistic and value-add managers will need to adopt their strategies now that interest rates are higher, and how their ability to generate out-size returns simply by adding leverage is gone. So, a number of important topics for us and investors to consider. We hope you find our answers insightful and useful in determining your strategy and thinking about some of the key questions in real estate as we move into the new year. Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy. Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs. We have already started to see cap rates and yields rise in many markets, with the most rapid adjustment taking place in the UK. However, we do not think that prices fully reflect higher interest rates yet. To assess when values might bottom out, we can look to past downturns and the listed market for guidance. In the Global Financial Crisis, for example, global capital values bottomed out in 4Q09, while GDP across global real estate markets troughed three quarters earlier, in 1Q09, as did global listed real estate prices1. Market downturns usually present opportunities, and one we expect for investors in 2023 is a correction in pricing as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. Although we do not expect large amounts of distress in the market, we do expect some, already apparent in parts of the UK market. This should allow investors access to assets at attractive pricing. The early 1990s downturn was longer, with US capital values continuing to decline into 1995. We expect modest declines in GDP in the first half of 2023 before growth resumes.',\n",

Apart from the project development segment, we expect few forced sales. We rule out a wave of non-performing loans like after the financial crisis. Nevertheless, the steep rise in interest rates is likely to put individual landlords under stress, especially in the value-add and opportunistic segments, where financing durations are typically short. Lower demand for space and rents due to the recession could jeopardise the implementation of the business plan and thus also refinancing.',\n",

Currently, it seems that debt costs are mostly winning the race. Ultimately, however, valuations are the result of the interaction between higher debt costs and the path of real estate fundamentals, the prospects for which vary widely across sectors and geographies. Tracing back real estate cash flows to their drivers is to follow a chain of causation back to basic variables like population, GDP, industrial production, consumer spending and employment.

Secular megatrends and structural features like legal and contractual constraints also matter. Going into 2023, there is increased uncertainty in many of these variables, especially the economic ones, given the pace of economic expansion is expected to be weaker or negative.

But here, too, the uncertainty about further developments is likely to be too great, at least temporarily. Another relevant lower edge for property yields is financing costs. At the end of the third quarter of 2022, prime yields in all major market segments were below the cost of debt capital . This situation could only persist if the number of equity buyers is sufficiently large. Indeed, such investors are currently quite active and are taking advantage of the lower prices for purchases. However, we think it unlikely that the existing equity volume will be sufficient to anchor prices below the cost of financing. The fact that the increase in initial yields is nevertheless likely to be comparatively flat is also due to the mostly comfortable financing situation on the part of the landlords. Apart from the project development segment, we expect few forced sales. We rule out a wave of non-performing loans like after the financial crisis. Nevertheless, the steep rise in interest rates is likely to put individual landlords under stress, especially in the value-add and opportunistic segments, where financing durations are typically short. Lower demand for space and rents due to the recession could jeopardise the implementation of the business plan and thus also refinancing.',\n",

For well-capitalized buyers, this creates opportunities to deploy capital in a less competitive market and will allow investors to add strategic targets to diversified portfolios. challenges in 2023 as lenders and core buyers view the sector as particularly risky.

Comparison of office markets in top locations There was little sign of any crisis in the top locations' office markets in the first half. The Covid-led dip in take-up has been largely ironed out by a bounce-back in de- mand for office space since the end of 2021.

Overall, the vacancy rate rose by 1.5 percentage points to around 4.5 per cent on the back of the pandemic, but as such remains fairly low.

Compiled by Nelson Economics. Note: Bold type indicates the 20 highest-rated markets in Emerging Trends in Real Estate 2023 survey for overall real estate prospects. 73 Changes in Attitudes, Changes in Latitudes Befitting the changes in economic and market trends and outlooks that we have highlighted in this report, respondents to the Emerging Trends survey expressed substantial changes in market preferences. Many of the changes were relatively minor, and nine of the 10 highest-rated markets last year repeated this year . But there were some material changes over the year as about a quarter of markets moved up or down in rankings by at least 10 places. And consistent with our normal- izing trend, many of the markets near the top of the standings last year have fallen this year, while many previously lower- rate markets have risen: More than half (11) of the 20-highest rated markets in last years survey fell in the rankings this year, although almost all by less than 10 places. Meanwhile, some of the markets that were found lower in the rankings in prior years are now finding more support. Thirteen of the 20-lowest rated markets in last years survey rose in the rankings this year. Some Like It Hot Despite the modest drop in the Supernova ratings this year, Emerging Trends survey respondents still see the best prospects in Sun Belt metropolitan areas, which have been growing over time. The number of Sun Belt markets among the top 20 markets for overall prospects has increased from 10 in 2011 to 14 in each of the past two years. At the same time, the number of markets in cold-weather climates in the Northeast and Midwest has declined from five to just two . These climate preferences are even stronger at the top and bot- tom of the rankings.',\n",
