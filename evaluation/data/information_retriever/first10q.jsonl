{"input": "List the current trends on german real estate market.", "ideal": {"paragraph": "Ulrich Höller on the shortage of skilled workers: “The shortage of skilled workers has turned into a serious business risk in the construction industry as well. At the beginning of 2022, in a survey by the Association of German Chambers of Commerce\nand Industry (Deutscher Industrie- und Handelskammertag – “DIHK”), 78 per cent of construction companies identified the shortage of skilled workers as the main risk to their own economic development. In 2010, by contrast, it was only 21 per cent. Labour costs have always been very important in the personnel-intensive construction industry. Here, only changes in the legal framework can produce relief: Germany urgently needs an efficient and targeted immigration law that provides the economy\nwith significantly more qualified and motivated workers who want to learn and prove\nthemselves.”\nUlrich Höller on the ESG topic: “The number one subject of discussion in 2021 was the implementation of ESG requirements. Even though it was pushed into the background in 2022, this will return to be the prevailing topic in the future. The issue of climate protection, decarbonisation and the required reduction of the CO2 footprint presents us with dramatically growing challenges around the globe. This is particularly true for the real estate sector, which accounts for almost 40 per cent of CO2 emissions worldwide. We will only be able to meet this challenge if we really move all levers at our disposal to address the issue seriously and with conviction. This also holds true for investors, especially as ESG suitability currently still means lower returns, and it\nremains to be seen who is willing to take this route under the present challenging conditions. Moreover, there will be a greater emphasis of the S and the G – the social and governance components. I think the real estate industry still has a lot of work to do in this respect, and there are significant opportunities for it to position itself.”\nUlrich Höller on portfolio allocations to real estate: “Most investors have continuously increased their portfolio allocation to real estate over recent years. Of course, there has been a slowdown now. Some investors initially halted their net acquisitions in response to this, also because bonds have become more attractive for them again. And yet, we do not see a sustained exodus of capital investments from the real estate asset class, which has gained dramatically in importance over the last decade, has become significantly more professional, and will thus remain a long-term component of portfolios.”\nUlrich Höller on the outlook for project developments: “The framework conditions for new project developments are worsening, at least temporarily. It will become increasingly difficult to structure both equity as well as loan financing, and their costs\nhave already increased markedly. The market will separate the wheat from the chaff: renowned and successful players with years of experience will hold up well and reliably receive funding, while opportunistic participants in particular will fall victim to a healthy consolidation process. But even current project developments cannot escape the changed framework conditions: many ongoing projects have to be reevaluated, which may lead to price corrections. Mezzanine capital is being looked at more critically; some project developments will certainly have to be restructured in terms of capital and project structure. Certain projects can no longer be profitable and will have to be terminated with a loss. In contrast, projects with good locations, top equipment and high design flexibility will survive; they might even benefit from declining supply.”", "filename": ["2022-12-12_ABG_Statements_Hoeller_2022-2023_en.pdf"]}}
