Furthermore, addressing this missing middle household income level does not preclude the need for additions to and preservation of properties for lower-income households. The Great Bottleneck: Local Ballot Boxes Apartment stakeholders number-one nemesis, blocking private- sector market solutions to deep and growing mismatches between demand and supply, is a many-headed hydraa bevy of deep-rooted restrictive land use, permitting, and regulatory cost burdens that thwart higher-density multifamily develop- ment. On top of these longstanding challenges, a growing push for rent regulation is adding uncertainty to the market. For example, while 26 states prohibit local municipalities from implementing rent control laws, five states permit localities to enforce rent controlNew York, New Jersey, California, Oregon, and Marylandas well as Washington, D. C. Regulations being proposed throughout the country would allow landlords to boost monthly rents by no more than 2 percent to 10 percent. Arizona, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, Washington, and Massachusetts have all introduced proposals to add or expand rent control protections. The problem of impact fees and NIMBYism really dominates many markets and makes it too expensive to develop, the CEO of one of the nations largest property management organizations says. I think were still stuck in the past. Some policymakers are not in tune. Voters who may not be well versed in these issues elect government officials who then become a huge wall to economic solutions. I dont see solutions for all this happening in my lifetime.",

                "text": " The residential sector as a whole is a beneficiary of the ongoing trend of urbanisation in major cities across Europe. Wealth tends to be concentrated in larger urban centres with better employment opportunities where the average age of the working population is lower than in regional and more remote communities. Demand for living assets remains strong in most urbanised areas due to demographic growth and the rising number of households, boosted by immigration and the expanding number of younger and older people living alone. The volume of new housing developments is also falling due to increasingly stringent environmental rules, shortages of materials and rising labour costs. Demand continues to outstrip supply, especially in the affordable segment. If the number of new-build projects continues to decline, the valuations of existing stock may hold up relatively well. Increases in mortgage rates mean home ownership will move out of reach of a growing group of people, forcing them to turn to the rental market for accommodation that fits their budgets. Residential real estate is seen as a relatively good inflation hedge as most rental contracts are index-linked but, in our view, it will not be possible to pass on the full level of consumer price rises to tenants. Governments in many countries are implementing measures to offset energy price hikes or cap rental increases to support the purchasing power of people living in social housing and other low- to middle-income tenants. Rising 10-year government bond yields will simultaneously pressure spread levels and yields will move out. This is demonstrated in the graph below which tracks the expected development of residential net initial yields against 10-year government bond levels for the leading European gateway cities.",

Furthermore, addressing this missing middle household income level does not preclude the need for additions to and preservation of properties for lower-income households. The Great Bottleneck: Local Ballot Boxes Apartment stakeholders number-one nemesis, blocking private- sector market solutions to deep and growing mismatches between demand and supply, is a many-headed hydraa bevy of deep-rooted restrictive land use, permitting, and regulatory cost burdens that thwart higher-density multifamily develop- ment. On top of these longstanding challenges, a growing push for rent regulation is adding uncertainty to the market. For example, while 26 states prohibit local municipalities from implementing rent control laws, five states permit localities to enforce rent controlNew York, New Jersey, California, Oregon, and Marylandas well as Washington, D. C. Regulations being proposed throughout the country would allow landlords to boost monthly rents by no more than 2 percent to 10 percent. Arizona, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, Washington, and Massachusetts have all introduced proposals to add or expand rent control protections. The problem of impact fees and NIMBYism really dominates many markets and makes it too expensive to develop, the CEO of one of the nations largest property management organizations says.

But returns will be coming down. The 43 economists and ana- lysts surveyed in October 2022 by ULIs Center for Real Estate Economics and Capital Markets expect total returns to drop to 3.8 percent in 2023, and recover to a moderate 7 percent in 2024. That is to say, more normal returns. That outlook tracks with the collective wisdom of respondents to this years Emerging Trends survey. More than half believe that capitalization rates are heading up next year and returns are coming down, primarily due to rising interest rates and cost of capital, which was the top economic concern voiced in our survey. After more than a decade of lower for longer, the Fed is finally normalizing interest rates closer to historical levels. Those rising interest rates are already driving up debt costs and thus the costs to acquire and develop property, reducing leveraged returns."

In addition, we analyze how opportunistic and value-add managers will need to adopt their strategies now that interest rates are higher, and how their ability to generate out-size returns simply by adding leverage is gone. So, a number of important topics for us and investors to consider. We hope you find our answers insightful and useful in determining your strategy and thinking about some of the key questions in real estate as we move into the new year. Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy. Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs. We have already started to see cap rates and yields rise in many markets, with the most rapid adjustment taking place in the UK. However, we do not think that prices fully reflect higher interest rates yet. To assess when values might bottom out, we can look to past downturns and the listed market for guidance. In the Global Financial Crisis, for example, global capital values bottomed out in 4Q09, while GDP across global real estate markets troughed three quarters earlier, in 1Q09, as did global listed real estate prices1. Market downturns usually present opportunities, and one we expect for investors in 2023 is a correction in pricing as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. Although we do not expect large amounts of distress in the market, we do expect some, already apparent in parts of the UK market. This should allow investors access to assets at attractive pricing. The early 1990s downturn was longer, with US capital values continuing to decline into 1995. We expect modest declines in GDP in the first half of 2023 before growth resumes.",

Unlike in the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and during the pandemic, nobodys coming to the rescue, and now we got to take our medicine, and here it comes, says the head of research for an investment management firm. Thus, the government is turning off both the monetary and fiscal spigots that had been support- ing commercial real estate and the economy overall. The head of a development company summarized it like this: I feel like weve been on a little bit of a sugar high with this stimu- lus and cheap debt. Theres going to be a slowdown. Theres got to be this normalization. So, what does that mean? I think its going to be a little bouncy. Its going to be a little bit turbulent. But then we bottom out, and we start back into growth. 2.  Still, Weve Changed Some  The pandemic forced structural shifts in how and where we live, work, and recreate in ways that seem destinated to endure.  Online spending is receding from its pandemic peaks but is not likely to revert to pre-pandemic levels. Business travel is unlikely to recover to pre-COVID levels for at least several years, meaning business hotels, fine dining, and conference facilities will continue to face challenges.  The greatest changes may be in how and where we work. The impact on office use and leasing is still evolving, and a significant share of the existing stock may need to be reposi- tioned to remain competitive.",

And not every market: some of the nations strongest gateway mar- kets, like New York City and San Francisco, experienced sharp outflows of residents, businesses, and tenants of all types. But overall and across much of the United States, property markets far outperformed expectations and historical norms. And now, more than two years on, property investors and managers are learning anew that whopping growth and profits eventually fall back to eartha reversion to the mean, to use finance jargon, or simply normalizing, as numerous industry experts we interviewed put it. Some looming market adjustments will be cyclical due to the weakening economic conditions that most economists and real estate professionals expect, while others represent more of a return to normalcy after all the pandemic-fueled market distortions. These market reversions will take several forms: prices of most assets are declining as cap rates rise and transaction volumes fall from record levels, while rent gains for others are merely moderating as demand returns to more sustainable levels. Perhaps the biggest surprise is that these reversals of fortune are hitting favored property sectors like multifamily and indus- trial. That does not necessarily mean the market corrections will be painful. In many cases, recent losses in property value will only trim already healthy gains. But many indicators suggest that the (really) good times may be over, at least for a while. Housing Set to Cool A finance executive with one national homebuilder told us, Were still selling.

After more than a decade of lower for longer, the Fed is finally normalizing interest rates closer to historical levels. Those rising interest rates are already driving up debt costs and thus the costs to acquire and develop property, reducing leveraged returns. At the same time, the federal government is done with providing stimulus, indirectly reducing tenant demand for space. Unlike in the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and during the pandemic, nobodys coming to the rescue, and now we got to take our medicine, and here it comes, says the head of research for an investment management firm. Thus, the government is turning off both the monetary and fiscal spigots that had been support- ing commercial real estate and the economy overall. The head of a development company summarized it like this: I feel like weve been on a little bit of a sugar high with this stimu- lus and cheap debt. Theres going to be a slowdown. Theres got to be this normalization. So, what does that mean? I think its going to be a little bouncy. Its going to be a little bit turbulent. But then we bottom out, and we start back into growth. 2.  Still, Weve Changed Some  The pandemic forced structural shifts in how and where we live, work, and recreate in ways that seem destinated to endure.  Online spending is receding from its pandemic peaks but is not likely to revert to pre-pandemic levels. Business travel is unlikely to recover to pre-COVID levels for at least several years, meaning business hotels, fine dining, and conference facilities will continue to face challenges.  The greatest changes may be in how and where we work. The impact on office use and leasing is still evolving, and a significant share of the existing stock may need to be reposi- tioned to remain competitive.",

However, we think it unlikely that the existing equity volume will be sufficient to anchor prices below the cost of financing. The fact that the increase in initial yields is nevertheless likely to be comparatively flat is also due to the mostly comfortable financing situation on the part of the landlords. Apart from the project development segment, we expect few forced sales. We rule out a wave of non-performing loans like after the financial crisis. Nevertheless, the steep rise in interest rates is likely to put individual landlords under stress, especially in the value-add and opportunistic segments, where financing durations are typically short.

This situation could only persist if the number of equity buyers is sufficiently large. Indeed, such investors are currently quite active and are taking advantage of the lower prices for purchases. However, we think it unlikely that the existing equity volume will be sufficient to anchor prices below the cost of financing. The fact that the increase in initial yields is nevertheless likely to be comparatively flat is also due to the mostly comfortable financing situation on the part of the landlords. Apart from the project development segment, we expect few forced sales. We rule out a wave of non-performing loans like after the financial crisis. Nevertheless, the steep rise in interest rates is likely to put individual landlords under stress, especially in the value-add and opportunistic segments, where financing durations are typically short. Lower demand for space and rents due to the recession could jeopardise the implementation of the business plan and thus also refinancing.",

                "text": " In our view, it is mainly explained by the ultra-loose monetary policy of the European Central Bank and in particular its active intervention in the bond markets. At the latest from 2015, when the ECB began extensive government bond purchases, the Bund yield was kept artificially low. The difference to initial property yields was distorted as a result. With the normalisation of monetary policy that has now begun, this situation should dissolve and the rise in real estate yields should be flatter than that of the risk-free interest rate. As a look at the early 1990s shows, prime real estate yields can even be below bond yields. Such a constellation presupposes high rental growth expectations. Given the current macro environment, we believe that investor expectations of rental growth are not sufficiently high for this in any sector. The logistics market and the less regulated part of the residential market might be an exception. But here, too, the uncertainty about further developments is likely to be too great, at least temporarily. Another relevant lower edge for property yields is financing costs."

We have reached that milestone in most parts of the world. The virus is no longer a major constraint on life in many countries.

A year ago, key uncertainties surrounding our predictions for moving beyond the acute pandemic phase were around issues like new COVID variants and booster deployment. As for todays economic situation, key uncertainties include:  How long will it take for inflation to come under control? How high must interest rates go in the meantime?

                "text": " G LO BA L 2 The path of fundamentals will ultimately help determine where values settle Early in 2022, we framed the impact of rising inflation and interest rates on values as a race between debt costs and net operating income growth, as we anticipated that higher inflation would translate into higher rents in some sectors. Currently, it seems that debt costs are mostly winning the race. Ultimately, however, valuations are the result of the interaction between higher debt costs and the path of real estate fundamentals, the prospects for which vary widely across sectors and geographies. Tracing back real estate cash flows to their drivers is to follow a chain of causation back to basic variables like population, GDP, industrial production, consumer spending and employment. All of these interact with real estate factors, such as the balance of property supply and occupier demand, to influence property cash flows. Secular megatrends and structural features like legal and contractual constraints also matter. Going into 2023, there is increased uncertainty in many of these variables, especially the economic ones, given the pace of economic expansion is expected to be weaker or negative. This will have a cooling impact on property NOI growth, but nuances remain given that the transmission of macroeconomic conditions to real estate is a winding path. Starting with the underlying economic fundamentals, we are seeing a great deal of variation globally. In addition to the dimensions of depth and duration, a key uncertainty surrounding the coming downturn is how widespread it will be. Europe faces especially severe challenges stemming from an energy price shock, with ripple effects of unknown global scope. The dominant driver of inflation in the US, Canada and Singapore is that their economies are robust and operating close to full capacity. Demand- led inflation is relatively benign compared to inflation from a supply shock, but the central banks in these countries must still raise interest rates, either to manage their domestic economic situations or because their monetary policies are linked to the US Federal Reserve . Rising interest rates create clear risks to economic growth, with housing markets already being impacted by higher mortgage rates. Europes employment picture is also solid, but in addition to home-grown inflation, it is coping with a severe, energy-driven supply shock caused by the Russia-Ukraine war.",

The denominator effect can be magnified because CRE values in a portfolio are generally appraisal-based, which tend to be backward-looking. However, the impact on CRE portfolios may not be severe this time. Many institutional investors have been under-allocated in CRE, so they will not need to rebalance by selling real estate assets. Furthermore, a rising share of CRE investors is not gov- erned by fixed asset allocations, including public REITs, private investment firms, and high-net-worth individuals, and especially nontraded REITs, which have grown to be among the leading investors in CRE, with an asset value of almost $300 billion in 2021. In sum, capital availability should decline in the near term, though the denominator effect may not force sales as much as in typical downturns. Uncertainty Hesitancy Perhaps the biggest headwind to getting deals done now is uncertainty over where prices will settle. Reflecting the views of many experts we interviewed, one senior investment banker says, Transactions are being done at cap rates that are anywhere from 25 to 75 basis points wider than they werebut there is not any conviction that these are the right levels. That translates into a 5 to 15 percent drop in values so far, with more to come. But there are too few assets trading now to know for sure. Buyers are concerned about overpaying. Says one banker: Now is not the time to be a heromeaning, its not the time to go out and be aggressive on buying something. Its not the time to be aggressive on borrowing. On the other hand, sellers dont want to sell their assets short and then see them retraded at higher prices once the markets improve and few suffer from the financial distress that forces them to. It all translates into fewer deals. One senior adviser to institutional investors said, Its pen- cils down in investment committee.

LOOKING AHEAD  The relentless math of higher interest rates will continue to weigh heavily on real estate values, at least until interest rates stabilize as inflation begins to subside. The bid- ask spread for private real estate should eventually close and transactions will resume in earnest at a rebased level.  In the meantime, investment styles that are less sensitive to volatility in values should be contemplated, such as floating-rate lending with a comfortable cushion from lower loan-to-value ratios. Debt investment can be attractive at times of uncertainty, as investors tilt toward contractually certain income and away from an uncertain upside. Portfolio aggregation strategies with smaller asset sizes that lend themselves to averaging-in with diversified timing of entry points represent another way to cope with volatile and uncertain values.  The inputs to the math are not changing to the same degree in every part of the world. Wherever rate spikes are less intense, or the prospects for rental growth are clearest, transaction activity and prices have been less impacted.  In addition to debt costs, investors should also consider the trajectory of cash flows, which depend on economic fundamentals and real estate occupier market conditions. The differential prospects for real estate cash flows are the subject of the next section.",

                "text": " And while interest rates are increasing, equity and bond prices have been falling, triggering the denominator effect for some institutional investors with asset allocations that must remain in balance. The denominator effect can be magnified because CRE values in a portfolio are generally appraisal-based, which tend to be backward-looking. However, the impact on CRE portfolios may not be severe this time. Many institutional investors have been under-allocated in CRE, so they will not need to rebalance by selling real estate assets. Furthermore, a rising share of CRE investors is not gov- erned by fixed asset allocations, including public REITs, private investment firms, and high-net-worth individuals, and especially nontraded REITs, which have grown to be among the leading investors in CRE, with an asset value of almost $300 billion in 2021. In sum, capital availability should decline in the near term, though the denominator effect may not force sales as much as in typical downturns. Uncertainty Hesitancy Perhaps the biggest headwind to getting deals done now is uncertainty over where prices will settle. Reflecting the views of many experts we interviewed, one senior investment banker says, Transactions are being done at cap rates that are anywhere from 25 to 75 basis points wider than they werebut there is not any conviction that these are the right levels. That translates into a 5 to 15 percent drop in values so far, with more to come. But there are too few assets trading now to know for sure. Buyers are concerned about overpaying. Says one banker: Now is not the time to be a heromeaning, its not the time to go out and be aggressive on buying something. Its not the time to be aggressive on borrowing. On the other hand, sellers dont want to sell their assets short and then see them retraded at higher prices once the markets improve and few suffer from the financial distress that forces them to. It all translates into fewer deals. One senior adviser to institutional investors said, Its pen- cils down in investment committee. We cant get an acquisition or disposition approved in investment committee at this time. The fundamental issue for many investors is how long the Fed will keep raising rates.",

LOOKING AHEAD  The relentless math of higher interest rates will continue to weigh heavily on real estate values, at least until interest rates stabilize as inflation begins to subside. The bid- ask spread for private real estate should eventually close and transactions will resume in earnest at a rebased level.  In the meantime, investment styles that are less sensitive to volatility in values should be contemplated, such as floating-rate lending with a comfortable cushion from lower loan-to-value ratios. Debt investment can be attractive at times of uncertainty, as investors tilt toward contractually certain income and away from an uncertain upside. Portfolio aggregation strategies with smaller asset sizes that lend themselves to averaging-in with diversified timing of entry points represent another way to cope with volatile and uncertain values.  The inputs to the math are not changing to the same degree in every part of the world. Wherever rate spikes are less intense, or the prospects for rental growth are clearest, transaction activity and prices have been less impacted.  In addition to debt costs, investors should also consider the trajectory of cash flows, which depend on economic fundamentals and real estate occupier market conditions. The differential prospects for real estate cash flows are the subject of the next section.",

Bid-ask spreads in real estate capital markets will narrow, allowing activity to resume at an adjusted pricing level.

A year ago, key uncertainties surrounding our predictions for moving beyond the acute pandemic phase were around issues like new COVID variants and booster deployment. As for todays economic situation, key uncertainties include:  How long will it take for inflation to come under control? How high must interest rates go in the meantime? There have recently been signs that inflation is peaking, but such hopes could prove fleeting.",

Many of the changes were relatively minor, and nine of the 10 highest-rated markets last year repeated this year . But there were some material changes over the year as about a quarter of markets moved up or down in rankings by at least 10 places. And consistent with our normal- izing trend, many of the markets near the top of the standings last year have fallen this year, while many previously lower- rate markets have risen: More than half (11) of the 20-highest rated markets in last years survey fell in the rankings this year, although almost all by less than 10 places. Meanwhile, some of the markets that were found lower in the rankings in prior years are now finding more support. Thirteen of the 20-lowest rated markets in last years survey rose in the rankings this year. Some Like It Hot Despite the modest drop in the Supernova ratings this year, Emerging Trends survey respondents still see the best prospects in Sun Belt metropolitan areas, which have been growing over time. The number of Sun Belt markets among the top 20 markets for overall prospects has increased from 10 in 2011 to 14 in each of the past two years. At the same time, the number of markets in cold-weather climates in the Northeast and Midwest has declined from five to just two . These climate preferences are even stronger at the top and bot- tom of the rankings.",

This is reflected in consumer sentiment which has fallen to a historic low. The GfK survey shows that income expectations have slumped to an even greater degree than the propensity to buy. This is bad news for city centre retail in two respects, with the need to make savings driving consumer spending down further. Nominal wages are rising comparatively strongly in 2022, however the growth is being more than offset by high inflation, probably of an annual average rate close to 8 per cent. Below the line, spending power is falling significantly, much more steeply than in the last three decades. While low inflation has supported retail activity since 2012 in the form of real wage growth, the opposite is now the case. Busy shopping centres and restaurants convey a different picture. However, house- holds are reluctant to spend. The German Federal Statistical Office reported an infla- tion-adjusted decline of 9 per cent in retail sales in June 2022 compared to the same month last year. Consequently, nominal and real retail sales diverged sharply at mid- year. The music sector is another example. Tickets for some concerts are selling so slowly that tours have already been cancelled.
