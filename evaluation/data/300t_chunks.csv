index_300t_chunks:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!6,2,isa-outlook-2023.pdf," The eerily weird Lang-2525 juxtaposition implicitly illustrates how resilient humanity can be, even while contemplating what seem like existential threats such as fascism, industrialization and robots in the 1920s, nuclear holocausts in the 1960s. Financial panics in the 1990s and again in 2008-2010 and climate change and geopolitical conflict in the 2020s. Josef Schumpeter is most well-remembered for popularizing the term creative destruction. He is less remembered for his work on democratic theory. To Schumpeter, democracy is the mechanism for competition among political parties in a market- like framework. The process of voting legitimizes leaders and keeps them somewhat accountable, yet their manipulation of the electorate and ability to control policy severely limits their capacity to serve all people fairly once they gain power. Schumpeters viewpoints were shaped by being an escapee of both the rise of fascism in 1930s Germany and of Soviet-style communism of the 1950sregimes that came to power through sham elections. Like the 2525 video, reading Schumpeter reminds us how the past, present and future all intersect. Geopolitical events in LaSalles target countries are as difficult to predict as the idiosyncratic motivations of their leaders. As researchers, we cannot know the future, but we can help devise strategies to cope with whatever alternative futures may arise."

Rising interest rates in most markets, except China and Japan, are expected to weigh on returns in 2023. Logistics rent growth is projected to continue, albeit at a moderating pace, driven by rising supply, slowing economies and rising occupier operating costs. The performance bifurcation across markets and submarkets within the same market is expected to widen. We expect submarkets with low projected availability and strong and diversified tenant bases to outperform. Logistics demand in Sydney and Melbourne, where vacancies are near zero, is expected to be supported by retailers shift from brick-and-mortar retail to the omnichannel model. We expect upgrade demand in Greater Tokyo and Greater Osaka to continue over the next two to three years. Although the pace of take-up could slow in these two markets, vacancy rates are expected to remain among the lowest in the region. We also expect continuing strength in Singapore and select markets in China , Note: The latest month international visitor arrival for UK is as of June 2022, for US is as of August 2022, for Australia, Hong Kong, South Korea and Germany is as of September 2022 and for Japan and Singapore is as of October 2022.

In response to the disrupted supply chains caused by the pandemic and the war, the majority of manufacturing companies have significantly increased their inventories and also rented additional space for this purpose. Just in time has become just in case. Many retailers have also acted in this way - partly also as a measure against supply problems, partly in anticipation of a post-pandemic consumption boom. Because of the weak demand, inventories are now likely to last much longer than expected in many cases and further storage space is not needed for the time being. In our view, there is much to suggest that demand for logistics space in the coming year and perhaps beyond will be lower than in recent years. However, we assume that demand will continue to exceed the supply of modern space and that vacancy rates will remain in the restrictive range. At the very least, prime rents are likely to continue to rise, albeit at a slower pace initially. This is all the more true after the economic downturn will have been overcome. Almost half of the European logistics users we surveyed expect to need more logistics space in the next three years and Germany is their number two expansion target. Only one in ten users is planning to reduce space. Sooner or later, online retail will also switch back into growth mode, although it will probably not be able to match the pace of earlier years. Nevertheless, a rising online share of retail sales increases the need for warehouse space."

Since then, this correlation no longer holds and rents have continued to rise despite increasing vacancies . We believe this is mainly due to the sudden shift in demand preferences towards higher quality office space. This qualitative change in demand has met and continues to meet a rigid supply in the short term. As a result, some of the space that was previously still marketable no longer meets user needs and has fallen vacant. All other spaces have become scarcer and thus more expensive because the entire demand now hits them.

Does real estate still provide protection against todays elevated inflation? Inflation is at a multi-decade high across the advanced economies due to strong demand and bottlenecks, as they emerged from the pandemic, and the energy crisis prompted by the Ukraine war. Looking back at previous eras of above- average inflation, there have been limited cases of negative real total returns for real estate. Additionally, during stagflation, data available for the US market in the late 1970s and early 1980s show that real estate outperformed equities and bonds. Inflation provides protection when it feeds through to rents and the income that landlords receive. Short leases which allow for rents to be re-geared in line with higher inflation is one protection, while within-lease rents linked to some measure of inflation is another way of protecting income. Furthermore, real estate sectors with lower capital expenditures and triple net leases are best positioned. The most exposed properties are those with short leases where weakness in the occupier market means that rents cannot be increased when renewing the lease and may even fall in a weaker economic environment. Those on long leases, which do not have any mechanism to increase rents prior to the expiry of the lease, will also likely be less resilient. Properties at notable risk of return erosion are ones whereby labor is a higher portion of expenses such as senior housing and hospitality."
index_300t_chunks:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!149,60,Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf," Office as Destination Office owners are dealing with the post-COVID paradigm on several levels. One crucial element is adjusting to changing demand of the physical space and office locations. Employers are putting thought and capital into improving the workplace experience. That involves not just healthy ventilation and light- ing, enough space per person, fitness centers, food service, meeting rooms, outdoor shared areas, and quiet space to make phone calls, but also an array of services. For example, some employers have apps that help workers plan their day and phys- ical requirements such as food, car service, or seat reservations while others provide concierge services. office footprint. Everybody is coming back to the office, its just a matter of when, said one senior finance executive. To me, the question is less about the lasting impact of COVID demand, and more the impact of the macro environment. Companies should make the workplace a destination instead of an obligation, said a consultant at an architecture firm. This phenom- enon is driving a bifurcation in performance between class A offices and class BC offices. Demand for new buildings with the latest environmental standards and the newest amenities remains strong, while older buildings that lack desired amenities are losing ground. Occupiers are voting with their feet and their wallets. JLL Research found that between the onset of COVID-19 and the second quarter of 2022, buildings delivered in 2015 or later had 86."

At a minimum, it has been the rebound that many had hoped for. At best, it has been something of a renaissance after two very challenging years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Rent Growth and Occupancy Levels Not Seen in at Least a Decade Heading into the final month of the fall 2022 leasing season, both rent growth and occupancy sit at all-time highs. The former sits right at 6 percentalmost three times greater than the 2010s decade normwhile the latter clocks in above 90 percentplus. That is the earliest the sector has ever crested above that 90 percent threshold on record. By the semesters start, it is almost a foregone conclusion that the year will kick off with never-before-seen occupancy rates. With student competitive housing also seeing record rent growth and occupancy rates as well, there is less pressure on purpose-built off- campus housing space than in years past.

Consider how to create value out of ESG regulations. Start performing relevancy assessments, collect ESG data, and consider setting targetsin that order. Before allocating resources to gather data, prioritize information that will likely be most relevant to your firm. You need to know what the data tells you before setting lofty goals that may or may not be attainable.  Evaluate the quality of your data. Baseline data quality is important. But you should also look at occupancy rates, usage times, and space definitions to ensure reliable and valid like-for-like comparisons and appropriate benchmarking.  Aim to avoid stranded assets.

Record prices for energy, production losses in industry and consequently the likelihood of recession, are an likely scenario in the next few quarters. In this difficult situation, which could continue for some time, companies are likely to think twice about whether they can afford to take on the long-term commitment of expensive office space. Demand for offices is therefore likely to be much more muted towards the end of 2022beginning of 2023 than it was in the first half of 2022. Consequently, rents, which have so far been pointing upwards, are likely to flatten."

After recovery in smaller markets outpaced the top 25 markets in 2020 and 2021, the acceleration in performance has shifted back to the top 25. Performance in the top 25 markets is trend- ing upward, although recovery is uneven across these markets. According to CoStar, New York, Boston, and Los Angeles have experienced the most robust year-over-year recovery so far in 2022, while markets such as San Francisco substantially lag pre-pandemic performance levels. New York has benefited from increased demand in all areas, particularly the early stages of international and business travel in the first half of 2022, followed by international and domestic leisure over the summer months. Improvement in Los Angeles was propelled by a higher concentration of luxury rooms, which were able to maintain, or even exceed, pre-pandemic rates with less price-sensitive guests. Bostons demand resurgence took off in the second quarter of 2022, primarily driven by increased levels of leisure and group travel. CoStar reports that Bostons market RevPAR through the first half of 2022 reached 88 per- cent of 2019 levels."

Its two largest economies, Japan and China, are seeing stable or loosening monetary policies as the rest of the world tightens. Meanwhile, monetary conditions in the smaller economies in the region closely resemble the dynamics in Western nations.  Key uncertainties include whether the Bank of Japan can continue to keep long-yields low and the prospects for China ending its COVID-Zero regime.  Real estate capital market activity in the region has remained relatively resilient, owing to the dominance of intra-regional and domestic capital flows.  Post-pandemic changes in ways of working and living are modest compared to other parts of the world, which suggests that the persistent sector divides observed elsewhere are likely to be less severe in Asia Pacific. A S I A PAC I F I C The outlook for major Asia Pacific economies is relatively benign in the global context. The developed economies of the region are experiencing inflation rates running below those of the West, although these economies are not immune to tightening financial conditions and slowing global economic growth. The odds of a recession in the next twelve months are increasing, but are still below those of other regions, especially Europe."

But office demand also could suffer as firms have less need to lease space to accommodate client visits. Those gains could moderate or even reverse if the online shopping share endures, however, as consumers shift some spending back from goods to nonretail services they avoided during the pandemic, like travel and entertainment. As one real estate investment trust (REIT) analyst notes, Theres still very healthy growth in e-commerce, but its no longer the lofty expec- tations we used to have at the height of the pandemic. With growth in online spending slowing, physical retailers will have an opportunity to regain some lost market share, espe- cially those that can bridge the gap between e-commerce and bricks and sticks. They survived very well in the pandemic and will probably continue to do well, says one investment con- sultant. Other winners will be the resourceful retailers that can provide consumers with compelling shopping experiences. But the permanent shift to greater online spending ultimately means that fewer shopping centers and retail space can survive.

Reopening as the pandemic entered the endemic phase saw supply chain stresses and uneven demand patterns drive shortfalls in the availability of goods and labor. The energy supply crunch resulting from European support for Ukraine added a huge exogenous cost shock to the existing global and regional price pressure, driving European inflation readings to the highest level in the world by the end of 2022, on top of the future costs of new commitments to defense spending. The war in Ukraine will eventually end, but barring an unexpected change in Russian leadership, the deflationary impact of its cheap natural gas to heat homes and power industry will not return. Political divisions within the European Union, long oriented around tensions between budget surplus economies like Germany and the fiscally fragile periphery, have begun to realign across energy fractures. States reliant on Russian gas, including Germany and Italy, are increasingly at odds with countries that have diversified sources of supply or significant domestic production capacity, such as Spain, France, Portugal, the Nordics and the Netherlands . The future of European fiscal integration will depend on the extent to which the bloc decides to pull together on inevitable large energy subsidies versus going it alone. The solo path may better reflect national market realities, but at the potential cost of being seen to beggar ones neighbors."

Apart from its size, the Berlin retail sector is characterised by several geographically separate prime locations. These include Tauentzienstrae which has the highest prime rents, Kudamm, Alexanderplatz with its high footfall, Friedrichstrae, and the on-trend Hackescher Markt. Added to this are around 70 shopping centres, the most prominent of which is the large Mall of Berlin. Prime rents stagnated at EUR 310 per m2 from 2016 to 2019 before falling by 13 per cent to EUR 270 per m2 by 2021. Since then they have stagnated at this level. The retail outlook in the attractive Ger- man capital is generally solid. However, there will be a lean period initially, since Ber- liners are likely to suffer more from high energy prices because their spending power is weak. The large supply of sales space in Berlins many shopping centres poses a challenge.

The broad retail offer ranging from classic consumer locations such as Spitalerstrae and Mnckebergstrae to luxury locations such as the Neuer Wall shopping street is attractive to customers. The only large city centre shopping centre between them is the Europa Passage mall. The pandemic has clearly had a negative impact on city centre retail in Hamburg, resulting in a large number of vacant proper- ties. By the end of 2021 prime rents were down by 12 per cent on 2019 to EUR 250 per m2, and have since been stagnating. To reduce the number of visible vacant properties, the Hamburg Senate has established a funding programme to enable creative businesses and start-ups to temporarily rent unused retail space. By the end of 2022 Karstadt Sport will accordingly become an Artstadt. In summer and autumn 2022, the former Kaufhof store is also being used for an exhibition by the street artist Banksy.

The Pandemic: This Time Is Different With the pandemic and the cascade of economic and social policies it set off, five macro apartment industry tailwinds reached gale-force levels:  One, there was a preexisting multigenerational avalanche of both rent-by-choice and rent-by-necessity demand for multifamily rental units.  Two, demand gathered speed and sweep as people sought larger living spaces to balance remote work and household life, and more outdoor living options.  Three, constrained construction of new supply, and a price run-up on the single-family for-sale front, spilled over into expanded apartment demand.  Lastly, compounding the effects of these four dramatic imbalances came the rocket fuel of a global capital rotation toward de-risked assets .

While plenty of challenged assets remain across the wide spec- trum of retail property types and geographies, the real question for these buyers is whether tighter debt markets will depress prices on high-quality assets. Meanwhile, the trend of mixed-use redevelopment and densi- fication playing out in the mall arena is likely to expand to other property types. Said one acquisitions director, We are actively looking for class B properties in class A locations where there is an opportunity to repurpose lifestyle, power, even grocery- anchored centers to mixed-use liveworkplay projects. We anticipate an uptick in retail investment across the board in 2023. As one institutional investor told us, Everyone is chas- ing industrial and multifamily, and there is greater uncertainty emerging around office. Retail pricing is going to offer better returns, but you need to know what youre doing. That said, I think there is greater clarity in retail now than there has been in a long time for investors. Hotels The lodging sector has made significant strides in its recovery since the height of the pandemic, highlighted by strong year- over-year improvement in revenue per available room (RevPAR). The improvement in RevPAR was driven in large part by strong increases in average daily room rates.

In our view, only the best development situations, with lower land bases and top tier sites, still make economic sense. The challenge should not be leasing up new developments but reaching a yield-on-cost at a sufficient spread to the higher interest and capitalization rates. In the US and Canada, higher interest rates are hurting house price affordability. As buying becomes out of reach for more households, this will boost residential rental demand. This is likely to be most beneficial for single-family homes for rent and suburban apartments and less impactful on urban apartments.

For nonresidential construction, cost increases were lower but still significant at 12.8 percent. Construction cost increases continued into the second quarter of 2022 amid inflationary pressures throughout the economy. Rising labor shortages are exacerbating the challenges. According to Statistics Canada, construction job vacancies reached a record high in the first quarter of 2022 and were double the number of open positions during the same period in 2020. And then there is the impact of construction wages, which were up 6.6 percent in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2021. All of this has made completing projects on time and on budget even harder than in the past, and the situation is unlikely to improve in the foreseeable future. The shortage of trades labor is not expected to get better any time soon and construction technologies have yet to evolve to make up the difference in cost or productivity. Adaptation Key as the Landscape Shifts for Canadian Real Estate What does this mean for real estate companies? For some, it adds further to the need to take a pause on activity. There have been rising projections, for example, of developers delaying or potentially canceling condo projects as it becomes harder to make the numbers work in these challenging conditions. Others are trying to manage this by spacing out advanced sales of new housing units to ensure that prices reflect rising costs as a project moves forward."

The rest of the world is not in the same situation as Europe, but its experience shows that conditions can change quickly and it is better to prepare for the future than to be simply reactive.  Physical climate risk must be managed at two levels: at the portfolio level, through assessment of exposure concentrations and consideration of how climate risk informs overall portfolio construction strategies. And at the property level, through evaluating both existing and potential new hardening strategies to be more resilient against particular hazards.  Incremental investments in hardening against physical climate change, increasing energy efficiency and installing on-site renewables may, in certain situations and especially for existing portfolio assets in Europe, offer one of the most attractive risk-adjusted returns on capital available today.  The transition to a decarbonized world also brings nonphysical transition risks that tend to be specific to local markets. These include changes in insurance availability and costs, regulations, taxes, incentives, and changes in tenant and capital market demand.

This could change as the climate crisis worsens, with both direct and indirect effects on housing demand. In regions with a higher likelihood of extreme weather events, housing demand is reduced due to a lower quality of life. For example, there could be a direct negative impact from rationing water to water the garden or fill up the swimming pool in the more arid regions. Fires are also more likely and tend to increase there. Heavily damaged forests or fields are also likely to dampen demand for housing, especially if such events become more frequent and nature fails to fully regenerate."

While the pandemic was gradually controlled in the second half of 2021, energy and food prices were already starting to climb. Political sanctions and additional supply-demand imbalances since the Russian-Ukraine war have fuelled inflation further to double-digit numbers not seen since the 1970s. In its bid to combat inflation, the European Central Bank raised benchmark interest rates in the Eurozone by 50 basis points in July 2022, the first rate increase since 2011. This was followed by a further rate increase of 75bps in August 2022 - the highest single hike since the launch of the euro in January 1999 - and an additional 75bps rise in October 2022. Further rate increases are anticipated. Other European central banks followed a similar trajectory, and in some cases at an even faster pace. The Swedish central bank raised its rates by a cumulative 150bps in the 10 months to October 2022 and the Danish central bank by 125bps. The UK likewise increased its benchmark interest rate by a cumulative 200bps during this period, with the latest rate hike to date of 75bps occurring on 3 November 2022."

But most have embraced a hybrid arrange- mentsome willingly because it is working for them and others begrudgingly to avoid a mass exodus of workersand are experimenting with hybridremote work schemes and testing new amenities and designs. In the short term, hedging bets often involves reducing office space moderately, renewing leases for shorter amounts of time, and embracing flexible lease strategies such as coworking. The sectors traditional long-term lease structures enable the extended experimental phase.

Market update and assessment of rental and investment markets 20222023 Ulrich Hller on the big picture of 2022: In 2022, the German commercial real estate market was defined by four central developments that put an end to the long- standing and unbroken economic upswing: firstly, there was the interest rate turnaround that brought significantly increasing financing costs. Secondly, the highest levels of inflation in decades, with very high energy prices and costs of materials, led to a considerable increase in building costs. However, due to the high number of halted projects and the corresponding drop in demand, there are already signs of improvement here. Thirdly, there was a glaring shortage of skilled workers, and finally the new reticence of many domestic and foreign investors, for whom Germany has temporarily lost its attractiveness. As a result, the German real estate market has slowed markedly: the number of requested and granted building permits decreased by almost 10 per cent. A whole series of real estate projects were put on hold or delayed."

This is presenting challenges for operators seeking to maintain census, much less grow and expand. Expenses, margins, and returns. Rising wage costs asso- ciated with temporary agency workers, overtime hours, and sick leave associated with COVID-19 have combined with dollars expended on personal protective equipment and ris- ing insurance costs to put significant pressure on expenses. Rent growth, while rising, has not been sufficiently able to offset expense growth for many operators. As a result, net operating income has been hard to achieve for manybut certainly not for alloperators of senior housing properties. Indeed, the U.

We will only be able to meet this challenge if we really move all levers at our disposal to address the issue seriously and with conviction. This also holds true for investors, especially as ESG suitability currently still means lower returns, and it remains to be seen who is willing to take this route under the present challenging conditions. Moreover, there will be a greater emphasis of the S and the G  the social 2 and governance components. I think the real estate industry still has a lot of work to do in this respect, and there are significant opportunities for it to position itself. Ulrich Hller on portfolio allocations to real estate: Most investors have continuously increased their portfolio allocation to real estate over recent years. Of course, there has been a slowdown now. Some investors initially halted their net acquisitions in response to this, also because bonds have become more attractive for them again. And yet, we do not see a sustained exodus of capital investments from the real estate asset class, which has gained dramatically in importance over the last decade, has become significantly more professional, and will thus remain a long-term component of portfolios. Ulrich Hller on the outlook for project developments: The framework conditions for new project developments are worsening, at least temporarily. It will become increasingly difficult to structure both equity as well as loan financing, and their costs have already increased markedly."

Reflecting the more cautious mood, the average rating for all property types together in our Emerging Trends survey fell more this year than in any year since the GFC. But that overall trend masks diverse underlying dynamics. Though the rating fell for 15 of the 25 property subsectors, they rose for the other 10, so sectoral preferences are moving in different directions, even if the general mood is less exuberant this year.

As a result, the industrys supplydemand balance is somewhat strained, with vacancy at its lowest point in many major markets across North America. Companies typically prefer to outsource their data center needs rather than owning and operating their infrastructure, opting to lease capacity from data center providers or migrate their operations to the cloud. The migration to the cloud alone is a major factor in the explosive growth of the data center industry. To meet the demand for cloud infrastructure, lead- ing cloud providers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are building some of the largest facilities or executing substantial leases from data center providers. Unlike traditional real estate assets, it is more accurate to measure data centers by power and not by square footage. While the physical space that a company occupies is part of its rental rate, the rate is generally structured according to the amount of power the company is using. Because of the worlds reliance on technology, the data center industry is more resilient in the face of economic downturns, enabling it to thrive in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic."

The Feds implementation of tighter monetary policy has prompted lenders to adjust rates and widen spreads. With speculation of an impending recession, debt availability has become limited and heavily dependent on characteristics specific to both the asset and the borrower. In addition, lenders may become more averse to lodging assets in drive-to leisure destinations and more enthusiastic about assets in traditional gateway markets, if group and individual business travel continues to increase. Borrowers with a proven track record in hotel investment, as well as strong lender relationships, will have a competitive edge. The impacts of climate change are becoming increasingly more apparent with the increased rate of natural disasters, flooding, and abnormal weather patterns.

Most private investors want to feel good about ESG but care more about profit, one interviewee told us. But amid rising investor expectations and growing evidence that companies with strong ESG track records are expected to be more profitable in the medium to long term, we also saw plenty of evidence of a willingness by interviewees to address these issues more proactively than in the past. From exploring solutions to reduce embodied emissions related to building materials such as concrete to increasing the proportion of electric vehicle charging locations in residential developments, companies are taking action on climate change. Navigating a Rising Imperative around Climate Disclosures While some real estate companies are still figuring out their ESG and net-zero strategies, the imperative to act quickly goes well beyond investor expectations. This includes the evolving area of climate disclosures, which will increasingly affect both publicly owned and private real estate companies in Canada. In the United States, for example, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has proposed a new rule requiring issuers to disclose climate-related information, including details about greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks. This means that SEC issuers that are real estate tenants, investors, or lenders would have to report this information, including disclosures about assets in Canada.

Firms are focusing on increasing workplace automation, bolstering diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, accelerating career growth opportunities, and offering more recognition and awards programs. Real estate firms of all sizes are seeking outsourcing opportunities to optimize operational capacities. There is continued interest in leveraging proptechs to help offer complementary, innovative services. While technology budgets tend to be more reserved, those who plan to increase spend have opportunities to improve efficiency and explore new revenue opportunities in fundraising and digital assets. 2 Forming a road map for changing times  THE WORLD ECONOMY is again in danger  Even if a global recession is averted, the pain of stagflation could persist for several years  For many countries, recession will be hard to avoid.1 This, from the World Banks latest global economic forecast, describes how the global economy is currently in a state of heightened uncertainty due to economic shocks that have threatened a pandemic-era recovery."

The following consequences are likely to result from an environment with structurally high inflation, a tendency toward somewhat higher nominal interest rates and negative real interest rates. First, prices will probably remain under pressure until the end of the interest rate hikes. Second, highly leveraged projects are significantly riskier than in the past decade, which should put the brakes on risk-taking investors. This scenario would therefore continue to allow risk-averse, long-term investors to achieve decent returns. 4.5 Risk scenario for 2023 and later: Structurally high inflation There are two main reasons why inflation could continue to spike upward. First, tax revenues bubble up when inflation rates are high. This allows for a very loose fiscal policy and boosts inflation, again. Second, a labor market in full employment and an acute shortage of labor and skilled workers raises wages. This is particularly true due to the impending wave of retirements, which is likely to increase demand for workers. Strong interest rate hikes increase the risk of recession and the risks to financial market stability. Therefore, central banks may tend to raise interest rates only tentatively. However, the history from the 1970s and the interest rate shock in the early 1980s teaches us that when inflation is structurally high, these risks are eventually accepted in order to bring inflation back under control. Bund yields rose from 5.2 in 1978 to 10."

For example, the press releases of the Federal Statistical Office reported further price increases until the third quarter, although the price index had already passed its peak. It was not until the fourth quarter that the price index of the Federal Statistical Office fell by 3.6 year-on-year and by as much as 5 compared with the previous quarter. The bulwiengesa data also indicated a further rise in prices, as the annual data published on December 10 are annual averages and the quarterly data are rolling four- quarter averages. In addition, transactions are only indirectly included in the time series via analysts. Higher-frequency and transaction-based time series are therefore more in focus. The monthly Europace index, for example, has been falling since the spring of 2022. From peak to trough, prices for existing homes fell by around 12, and the index for apartments by as much as 15. However, prices for new homes initially ran sideways and then recently picked up again. In February 2023, the most recent data point, new home prices even increased strongly by more than 2 from the previous month. All three price indices are also published as hedonic indices, which factor out differences in quality."

While rising sustainability and net zero carbon pressures will drive a divide between the best and the rest across all sectors, we expect the dispersion to be widest in the office sector. This is because the outlook for offices in many markets already faces challenges from both an occupational and capital market perspective.  The uneven impact of a return to physical offices in the living with COVID phase of the pandemic shows that investors should avoid projecting their own countrys view of a sector too far away from their home market.

One sign of this is that the language around vaccinations has changed. No longer do we talk about being fully vaccinated or not, but about whether we are up-to-date on our seasonal boosters. Case counts continue to ebb and flow, but the incidence of serious health outcomes has fallen precipitously given widespread vaccine-based and natural immunity in most populations. As a result, COVID restrictions have been largely eliminated around the world. In the US and Europe, it is becoming rare to see anyone wearing a mask."

However, there are still a number of large transactions in the pipeline which means that take-up could catch up in the second half. Frankfurt's office market does not just have the highest prime rents. It also has the highest vacancy rate at just over 8 per cent most recently. That being said, the Covid-led rise remained contained at 1.5 percentage points, reflecting not least a rather moderate level of new space. Apart from the vacancy rate, the dampening effect of the energy crisis and threat of recession along with a fairly large volume of space under construction of over 600,000 m2 are likely to hamper a further sharp rise in prime rents. Frankfurt's skyline is currently in the process of gaining several new skyscrapers such as the Ensemble FOUR."

Prime rents have risen to the highest level in Germany, although the city centre has a relatively large volume of sales space of half a million m2. The highest rents are paid in Kaufingerstrae, Neuhauser Strae and Maximilianstrae. Despite the fact that shop rents are the highest in Germany, by the end of 2021 prime rents had fallen by 9 per cent  no higher than in the other top locations - to EUR 315 per m2. Munich thus remains the only German retail location with a prime rent of more than EUR 300 per m2. One major project is the conversion of the Karstadt building between Stachus and the central station. Its new construction is a much larger-scale project again. Efforts are also under way to extend the pedestrian zone to include the 350 metre long Tal (valley) street between Marienplatz and the Isartor. Prime rents in the Tal of currently around EUR 100 per m2 could increase sharply as a result, with a corresponding impact on the tenant mix."

Governments also need to acknowledge the ways that their actions hinder affordability by adding significant costs onto the construction of new housing. In many communities, fees, charges, and taxes levied by different orders of government make up a very substantial portion of the cost of a new home. In December 2021, for instance, the Building Industry and Land Development Association released a study of the Greater Toronto Area housing market that noted that government-imposed taxes and fees account for as much as 24 percent of the price of a new home. And in some municipalities, plans are in the works to raise this significantly. This includes Toronto, where the city council recently passed a plan to raise residential development charges by 46 percent by 2024. Such actions, along with lengthy development approvals and other municipal policies, only add to homebuilding costs, which, in turn, worsens affordability. Governments also need to prioritize setting aside new land for development as well as more proactive efforts to facilitate the densification of some existing neighborhoods. These are just some of the changes required, but the central theme is a focus on having consistent alignment around increasing supply."

There the number of inhabitants was on a roller coaster ride due to the pandemic. This is probably due to the large number of students and university employees who moved away from Heidelberg during the pandemic. In 2020, the number of inhabitants shrank by around 1.8 from 161,500 to just 158,700. From 2021 onwards, the number of inhabitants picked up again and, according to our calculations, reached a new all-time high in 2022. As a result, we expected bottlenecks to end in 2028 in both our current and 2021 housing market outlooks, and in the interim in 2022 our methodology indicated no bottlenecks. However, we considered a rapid resurgence of shortages after the pandemic which has now been confirmed. 4.

Moreover, the issue of putting large housing companies into cooperative ownership is likely to be back on the agenda in the spring of 2023 when the Berlin Expropriation Commission expects to publish its findings. Housing companies are likely to hold back from rent hikes in order not to pour further oil onto the fire. All this is taking place at a time when rent rises are nec- essary, if nothing else because of higher maintenance costs. Rents in major German cities are only likely to rise moderately until 2023. On bal- ance, we expect an increase in initial rents in the region of around three to four per cent until the end of 2023. This would mean rents rising slower than consumer pric- es. Livelier interest is on the cards from potential tenants for newly built, contempo- rary flats with good energy efficiency and correspondingly cheap heating costs. However, already high cold rents are having a dampening effect."

Sustainability is not completely top of mind on the U. S. political agenda which is focused more on social inclusion. The corporate and international investor community is, however, acknowledging the need for more sustainable buildings. Individual cities rather than the national government are leading the U. S. on this topic. Prime offices in the sunbelt cities appear to be better positioned due to migration patterns and rising employment and the drop in values is expected to be confined to around 5 over 2022. During the outlook period we expect East and West Coast office values to shed roughly an additional 10 while pricing in the Sunbelt cities and Miami will, for the most part, remain relatively steady.

Niche property types occupy five of the top-rated six slots for investment prospects, as shown in chapter 2, including the two top subsectors, workforce housing and data centers. This shift partly reflects investor expectations that cyclical trends will reduce returns in 2022 and 2023, intensifying the eternal search for yield. That search will favor some of these smaller product types that generally command higher cap rates and returns relative to the traditional product types. Why? Exits are less certain because these assets tend to be more thinly traded. Moreover, there is less reliable operating data, and these prod- ucts often require more specialized management, raising the risks for investors lacking experience in these sectors. The significance of these factors is likely to recede as more investors enter these sectors. That potential looks to get a boost from an unlikely, if wonky, source: NCRIEFs Property Index .

Likewise, power center vacancy in the United States fell below pre-pandemic levels as of the second quarter of 2022 . Unanchored strip center vacancy has followed a similar trend. But this rebound has been uneven. It has overwhelmingly favored class A projects, especially those in primary or high-population growth markets. Above all, it has favored the suburbs. The pandemic accelerated many of the issues facing urban retail in high street or central business district (CBD) locations. With tourism levels still below pre-pandemic norms for many cities and a diminished pool of office workers, most high street retail districts continue to struggle to return to previous foot traffic and sales levels. But the most pronounced issue for urban markets is that of ground-floor amenity retail in office towers. While workers continue to slowly trickle back to the office, daily occupancy levels remain 30 percent to 45 percent below pre-pandemic norms on any given day in most downtown markets. This space will remain challenged until either higher levels of daytime occupancy return or rent models are updated to deal with this new reality. Meanwhile, the mall sector continues to face vacancy levels well above pre-pandemic readings. However, as one mall analyst told us, It is important to remember that nowhere is the bifurca- tion in performance greater than in the mall world. Class A and trophy malls account for roughly one-third of the inventory, but 80 percent of the sales."

However, this will only persist if high inflation eases again and falls below the 2 target. Otherwise, there is a threat of further interest rate tightening. In the short term, the current high uncertainty and financial stability risks are likely to limit the potential for interest rate hikes.

For example, inflation in the 1970s ended with the Volcker shock and massive interest rate hikes. These led not only to a severe recession, but also to the Latin American crisis. So if inflation remains structurally high, sooner or later interest rates could rise again sharply. House prices could then come under renewed pressure. In this scenario, however, almost all investments are likely to lose value, and investments in the German housing market could still perform relatively well compared with other asset classes.

The second quarter was anything but good in terms of economic growth and compared to the rest of the Eurozone. Seasonally ad- justed GDP merely stagnated in the spring, after growing by a revised rate of 0.8 per cent in the first quarter compared to the previous quarter. The German Federal Sta- tistical Office referred to the difficult global economic conditions in the second quar- ter, the ongoing Covid pandemic, the disruption to supply chains and the war in Uk- raine. Various key indicators show a marked deterioration in outlook. We believe the German economy is likely to slip into a recessionary phase in the summer quarter (Q322). Even without a gas shortage, continuing high gas and electricity prices could lead to self-rationing for companies and consumers, which would be likely to slow economic growth notably, particularly in the coming quarters. The German eco- nomy is therefore expected to shrink by around 2 percent in 2023. There is still no sign of inflation easing (HICP). Relief measures, such as the fuel dis- count and the 9 Euro ticket, expired at the end of August. To make matters worse, consumers are facing an expensive gas levy from October. Gas and electricity prices have also increased again sharply, particularly in July."

Prior to the pandemic, travelers from China made up the majority of San Franciscos international visitations. With nonessential overseas travel still banned in China as of the late September 2022 publication of this report, it is uncertain when San Francisco will experience the same benefits from inbound international traffic as other markets. The outlook for business traffic in San Francisco also is unclear, as the tech workforce has largely shifted to hybrid and remote working models. Condition of the Labor Market In the early stages of the pandemic and prior to the rollout of vaccines, thousands of workers in the lodging industry lost their jobs through furloughs, layoffs, or permanent property clo- sures. The industry had also historically relied on an immigrant workforce and international contract work- ers, which was initially halted by government and international travel restrictions. This reduction in labor forced properties to adjust their operating models and scale back service offerings, most notably daily housekeeping, room service, and restaurant operations. Following an efficient vaccine rollout nationwide, leisure travel recovered relatively quickly, driving occupancy and nightly room rates to levels that allowed properties to once again support an increased workforce. However, hotel employees did not return with nearly the same enthusiasm as travelers did. These former industry workers had found other jobs and, in many cases, higher pay, increased benefits, and greater scheduling flexibility."

Experimenting with amenities and lease terms has helped revive the flexcoworking segment. Theres more of a corporate footprint in coworking. It provides more flexibility in terms such as lease length and amount of spaceyou can take a smaller footprint than you could elsewhereand companies can pick up the amenities coworking has to offer, said a data firm execu- tive. A bank executive said, It allows us to provide amenity-rich space when we dont have critical mass in an area. The new emphasis on flexibility is enabling coworking to recover after being hard hit by the pandemic. A related strategy, the hub-and-spoke model, which meant setting up remote offices in suburbs outside a central headquarters, has not gained traction. Few companies have a large-enough concen- tration of workers in any area away from a headquarters to justify an entire office. No ones figured that out yet, said a senior researcher."

And Canadas stability and immigration trends have made the country an attractive place in which to invest. Then came 2022, with its mix of interest rate increases, high levels of inflation, and a geopolitical environment that has created uncertainty throughout the global economy. The result has been a significant disruption to the Canadian real estate market. But while the changing environment in 2022 has been a shock for some, the long-term outlook is positive, since the fundamental underpinnings of the Canadian property market remain strong. This is why now is the time to invest in solutions to create value beyond the short-term uncertainty. concern previously was about too much capital creating even more competition for deals and pushing up prices for assets, the opposite is true now due in large part to a succession of interest rate increases by the Bank of Canada. Lenders, according to interviewees, have been tightening bor- rowing requirements that, coming on top of higher financing costs, are making it harder for real estate companies to raise capital and move projects forward. This, in turn, is leading to reduced competition for deals during a period of price discov- ery as sellers and buyers find themselves at odds over pricing expectations and valuations as some real estate assets come under pressure."

Off-price apparel has returned to robust growth, with players like Kohls and Burlington experimenting with smaller-format stores to facilitate expansion into new mar- kets. Athleisure and new digital-native apparel brands have ramped up brick-and-mortar growth even as department stores and many legacy players are still facing challenges. Perhaps most surprising of all is the massive surge in restaurant growth. Fueled by QSRs and new fast-casual concepts, major chains were poised to add as many as 7,000 units through midyear 2023. Dominant players like Starbucks, Chipotle, Chick-fil-A, McDonalds, and Dunkin have all ramped up growth, and inten- sified competition for coffee, chicken, and new Asian concepts is expected. Of course, not all retail sectors are in growth mode. Theaters remain deeply challenged and we anticipate consolidation ahead. Retail banking continues to deal with digital disruption, driving less need for overall branches and smaller footprints. Drugstore chains are reducing store counts, though online pharmacy has yet to emerge as a major disrupter. Department stores, particularly outside of the luxury sphere, still largely need to downsize and evolve their models to remain relevant. But 2021 saw the lowest number of retail chain closures since 2018."
index_300t_chunks:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!151,60,Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf," Impact on Capital The overarching issue remains: how much will work-from-home change demand for offices? Some industry players main- tain that the new flexible work paradigm will be in the rearview mirror in a few years, since managers want workers in the office for reasons noted above and eventually will succeed in getting them back. Proponents also contend that for every company cutting space, they can point to others that are growing their Pro-office proponents note that the total number of office-using jobs in the United States was 5 percent higher than pre-pan- demic levels as of midyear 2022, and the growth is even higher in Sun Belt metro areas such as Austin, Atlanta, Dallas, Tampa, and Denver. The argument is that the reduction in demand caused by WFH will be offset by the growth in the number of office-using employees and the increased space taken up by design changes, i. e. more collaborative and open space. Not to mention that companies will be hard pressed to cut desks when on some days the entire workforce will be in the office. The idea that WFH will be a drag on office demand is overrated. Looking at the data, the story is oversold, said one researcher. Since the start of the pandemic, the U. S. office vacancy rate has increased by 200 to 300 basis points and sublease space has increased another 100 to 150 basis pointsfar from the forecasts of massive space cutbacks."

However, the rise in the amount of new space has taken place from a low level and has so far applied above all to Ber- lin. New offices are also expected to be built in 2022 and 2023  especially in Berlin, but also in Hamburg. Rising prime rents are mainly being driven by demand for modern space, which is still ultimately in far too short supply. In contrast, rising vacancies tend to involve out- dated space or space that is only up-to-date to some extent and therefore hardly marketable any longer. This also reflects an earlier gradual fall in demand for office space. The trend in demand towards generally less space, but high-quality space in- stead is also likely to continue. However, the existing office stock is largely made up of ageing offices. Around three quarters of offices in the top locations pre-dates the turn of the millennium.

Even as property markets begin to normalize in many ways after some of the disruptions of the past few years, we wont be resum- ing our former lives in some key respects. The pandemic forced structural shifts in how and where we live, work, and recreate in ways that seem destinated to endure at least at some level, even if less extreme than our behaviors during the peak of COVID. Many activities have already returned to pre-pandemic levels, of course, especially those involving socializing. Americans are back to attending concerts and sporting events, and leisure travelers, at least, have returned to the nations roads and airways.

In the post-Global Financial Crisis period proved to be a particularly effective strategy, as interest rat were held at record lows and even negative in large parts o the market. use e this es f However, with interest rates now rising and expected to continue to do so, the returns which can be generated from leverage alone will dwindle. As a result, managers will need to amend their investment strategies and focus predominantly on the real estate angle to achieve higher returns. This will mean efficient and effective asset management initiatives, such as refurbing assets, reducing vacancy and growing rents. And also a laser focus on construction and labor costs given sharp rises in them. And ensuring buildings meet ESG criteria. Managers will also likely be able to generate higher returns by harnessing their skills in sourcing distressed opportunities which become available at discounted prices. As well as finding such deals, managers will need to be able to assess what the appropriate pricing is for them. In particular, they will need to ensure they do not buy an asset at a seemingly attractive price, only for the market to subsequently weaken further. This requires a specific skillset and expertise to source and secure assets at the right price in order to generate value."

Economists point to elevated vulnerabilities in global housing markets and a risk of a sudden price reversal if financial conditions were to tighten significantly.23 However, some fundamental forces can help explain why pricing appreciation may endure, albeit slower than the recent torrid pace: better homeowner financial stability and lasting supply constraints. Compared to the rampant development of subprime markets prior to 2008, tighter credit standards today have built a stable foundation for longer-term fixed-rate mortgages. Global markets such as Germany and the United Kingdom have also increasingly adopted this mortgage structure.24 And prices continue to be propped up as the housing market remains woefully undersupplied, exacerbated by pandemic-related construction delays, shortages of materials and labor, and supply chain bottlenecks.25 In the United States, housing specialists dont foresee average global home prices falling over the coming year, but pockets in the most overvalued regions could experience corrections, especially if local governments intervene.26 Deleveraging initiatives by the government in China Mainland, for instance, have slowed investment and prices have slumped.27 Deloittes baseline economic forecast still expects house prices to rise faster than inflation,28 at least in the United States.

More than a third of workers believe that companies demanding more office attendance are bluffing and will not act if employ- ees do not comply, according to the recent Survey of Working Arrangements and Attitudes by WFH Research, an academic team that explores office issues. Workers feel that way because the labor shortage, especially in high-skill segments such as technology, gives them leverage. Would a recession change the dynamic? Some say yes.

In the short term, therefore, policymakers could further tighten rent regulation to at least alleviate the symptoms of the housing shortage. For example, at the end of November Hamburg proposed legislation to introduce a cap on index-linked rents. Because more landlords are currently relying on such index-linked rents, we believe that their tighter regulation is a scenario that landlords should prepare for. As stronger regulation acts as a barrier to market entry, such and similar regulatory interventions reinforce the defensive investment character of residential real estate. They cap the potential for rental growth, but precisely because of this they have the effect of tightening supply and thus ensure very secure and stable returns. For risk-averse investors, the market thus remains attractive in principle. Against the backdrop of the climate targets for the German building stock, which have so far been missed by a wide margin, regulatory pressure could also increase here. A range of measures is conceivable, from renovation incentives to usage bans, as already exists in other European countries. These no longer only affect the income side, but also the cost side and thus represent a completely different kind of risk. This risk can only be eliminated with the purchase of new buildings or energy- efficient renovated existing buildings, so risk-averse investors are likely to focus even more on this part of the market."

Climate change may alter the dynamics of where people want to live and invest. In addition to the discomfort and health risks of living in ever-hotter climates, energy costs rise with temperatures, as do the risks of power outages as more strain is placed on power grids. Extended drought condi- tions may limit new development because authorities may limit new hookups.

German entrepreneurs are likely to actively try to keep workers here or recruit new ones. The incentives for Ukrainian refugees to remain in Germany or at least to return here again and again are correspondingly high. According to the Federal Statistical Office, 1.01 million Ukrainians will have immigrated by the end of 2022, significantly fewer than the 1.3 million we expected. However, we continue to assume an immigration of 1.6 million refugees and expect an influx of 380,000 persons in 2023 and a plus of 258,000 persons in 2024. Added to this is regular immigration from other countries. If 1.6 million Ukrainians stay here permanently and immigration is permanently above 300,000 people per year, the population in 2030 will be almost 86 million. Here we have assumed negative natural population growth as in 2021 of 220,000 persons per year. 2022 and 2023: Supply decline, we expect only a moderate recovery Due to the interest rate shock, developers and home builders put construction projects on hold or cancelled them.

Reason enough to encourage landowners to consider what reuse options exist before demolishing buildings to make way for new construction. 7. Rewardsand Growing Painsin the Sun Belt  Despite their continued popularity among residents, employ- ers, tenants, and investors, some Sun Belt markets are experiencing growing pains. Big city problems are coming to these markets known for their affordability and quality of life after years of continuous economic and population growth.  These destination markets typically offer lower tax rates and lighter regulatory burdens than many gateway markets, heightening their appeal to many businesses. Conversely, some of these attractive characteristics may limit their capac- ity to accommodate continued massive population inflows.  These markets will remain popular for both business and residential in-migration but could see the pace of both occur at more moderate levels. A growing number of developers are honing the skills required to understand which buildings are most amenable to trans- formation at a feasible price point and to undertake the complexities of conversions.

The indirect effects on demand for housing could be even more significant. For example, entire value chains could be broken and business models rendered unprofitable if infrastructure is damaged by heat, dried-up rivers or fires. As prices and rents rise in line with incomes in the long term, rents in the affected regions could rise or fall less sharply. Regions that will be less affected by extreme weather events in the future, on the other hand, could experience higher demand, prices, and rents. Much information is lacking to estimate which regions are more likely to be winners and losers. For example, the impact of the climate crisis on Germany's regions is unclear. But it also remains questionable to what extent it will be possible to contain or even prevent climate damage through behavioural change, construction measures, precautions and good crisis management. The first indications are provided by the extensive data of the German Weather Service. Schleswig-Holstein, for example, tends to have low average summer temperatures, while BerlinBrandenburg tends to have high average temperatures. Historically, the difference between the two regions has averaged about 1.5C, and in recent years it has even been around 2C. Bavaria and Baden-Wrttemberg tend to have higher temperatures than Schleswig-Holstein, probably due to the higher number of sunshine hours."

Particularly among employees over 55 years of age, whose share according to occupational classification is around 19, willingness could be limited. Likewise, about one-sixth of the 180,000 skilled workers had no training at all. In this group, too, retraining could not be a foregone conclusion. In addition, the already high shortage of skilled workers must be taken into account. From 2012 to 2022, vacancy times for open positions in the plumbing, heating, and air-conditioning trades have risen from around 100 days to almost 240 days. The upcoming wave of retirements is expected to further exacerbate the situation. Likewise, there may be construction obstacles to heat pump installation. However, there are also a number of pro-arguments. For example, the learning curve for the new technology is likely to be steep. The number of workdays to install a heat pump could drop. Likewise, manufacturers could improve heat pump efficiency. The high level of political will, the high and long-term growth in demand and the provision of billions in subsidies give manufacturers planning security and also make research and further development attractive. The annual coefficient of performance, which measures the ratio of thermal energy to electrical energy, could increase significantly. In practice, many heat pumps currently have an annual performance factor of around 3. In the future, modern heat pumps could have significantly higher values."

The divides between property types have come to dominate the impact of asset selection, quality and micro-location, which had been more salient in the past. While sector divides remain, other factors are gaining in relative importance. Winning sectors like residential and logistics have consistently posted stronger returns than pandemic-challenged sectors like retail or hotels . In both public and private markets, the data show that the dispersion between the strongest and weakest performing sectors is exceptionally wide. While the supportive growth dynamics underlying the industrial and residential sectors remain in place globally, the math means that rising debt costs are hitting capital values hard in lower-yielding sectors. For example, the share prices of listed apartment companies in developed markets have fallen by 30 since the beginning of 2022 until November 25, 2022, versus 19 for the rest of the listed real estate market."

These investors are using data to demonstrate that supporting the financial, physical, and mental well-being of their tenants enhances their ability to deliver market-rate, risk-adjusted returns.

In 2021 alone, the U. S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration identified 18 separate billion-dollar disasters in the United States. Many of these types of eventsand the material risk they pose to the real estate industryare unavoidable in the near term, irrespective of the emissions scenario. As extreme weather events continue to grow in frequency and intensity, the real estate industry must protect the long-term value of their assets.

In locations with a surplus of retail space - including an increasing number of shopping centres - alternative uses are needed, and in other locations suitable space must be created for retail. In most cases, both require structural interventions, but in any case investments. Stable cash flows may be becoming rarer on the retail property market, but the playing field is large for project developers and other value-added investors. Retail markets Even more than two and a half years after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, sales in the brick-and-mortar retail trade are still below the previously achieved level. In view of the massive loss of real purchasing power of private households, this is not likely to change in 2023. The lower sales are accompanied by higher costs, so that the already high pressure on retailers has increased even more. The number of insolvencies has already risen recently and this development is likely to continue in the coming year. Rising vacancy and rent default risks are the result."

ESG Disclosures Pressures for greater ESG disclosure by real estate owners and investors are intensifying. In October 2021, the two primary industry groups for institutional investorsthe National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries (NCREIF) and the Pension Real Estate Association (PREA)jointly released their ESG Principles of Reporting for Private Real Estate handbook for reporting ESG factors, as well as diversity, equity, and inclusion , for private real estate investment managers. The handbook emphasizes that the principles presented . . are best practices only and should not be considered requirements in order to claim compliance with the Reporting Standards . Nonetheless, these principles likely will be widely adopted by institutional inves- tors, given NCREIFs and PREAs influence in their respective communities. The NCREIFPREA guidance joins a growing list of standards and tools being developed to help investors and regulators in their quest to accelerate decarbonization in the built environment and promote broader ESG adoption by the private sector. Moreover, the impact of this greater disclosure could be felt more widely throughout the real estate industry due to the mar- ket size of pension funds and other institutional investors. Some of our clients really resist adapting the ESG protocols, but I think the capital demands it, notes one senior adviser to institutional funds."

An array of climate analytics data, software, and consulting services has emerged in response to the changing climate and the attendant shifts in policy frameworks, regulatory environ- ment, and growth in investor focus on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues. These data providers offer a wider range of commercialized science applications designed to help institutional real estate managers identify, measure, and describe physical risk at the asset and portfolio scales. While these tools offer an opportunity to evaluate current and future physical risk. The process by which investors integrate the infor- mation into investment decisions is currently opaque. The Challenge of Climate Risk Analytics Differences in climate risk analytics providers input data and methodology for estimating risk can make it difficult to compare results of analyses. For instance, within their product offerings, these firms often create summary metrics that aggregate the risk of multiple individual hazards. When aggregated, the weighting factors and hazards included vary by provider. Likewise, when calculating risk, providers may or may not include government, municipal, or asset-level risk mitigation considerations. Some providers, in addition to determining the likelihood of physical risk to assets, also calculate value-at-risk (VaR) to assets, where VaR represents the expected financial loss stemming from an event. Providers that offer a VaR measure tend to introduce further variation in outputs."

They were already doing right, and then the COVID tailwinds really accelerated the growth. However, there are signs that the pace of this migration may easeeven as developer interest and investments are still gain- ing momentumrisking oversupplied markets. While job growth and income growth in these markets far outdistance national trends, home prices and rents are growing even faster, compro- mising the affordability that helped made them draw migrants in the first place. Inflation rates in Phoenix, Atlanta, Tampa, and other popular Sun Belt metro areas are among the highest in the country, partly due to surging housing costs, which make up a significant portion of the inflation calculation. What happened? For some markets, it was just too much, too soon. Population in the markets we identified last year as either Supernova or Super Sun Belt grew by an average of over 5 percent since 2019, almost four times faster than the rest of the nation, primarily due to rapid net in-migration.

Pressures for greater ESG disclosure by real estate owners and investors are intensifying due to efforts both from indus- try groups like NCREIF and PREA and from government regulation by the SEC.  As shelter costs increasingly strain household budgets, state and local governments are resorting to regulation to address affordability, including various types of rent control and vacancy taxes.  While building owners and developers benefit from various government incentives, the industry faces an increasingly challenging set of environmental and economic regulations. Will certain regulations end up being counterproductive?

Multi-family rental supply in China and Australia is expected to increase in the next two to three years. Rising supply could also help to bridge the gap between demand and supply in China but is unlikely to cause oversupply in the near term, given the high occupancy rates and a healthy demand outlook. In Australia, supply is expected to increase, but from low levels of existing stock. We expect the sector to remain an outperformer, especially in the context of macroeconomic uncertainty. Multi-family assets have been historically favored by investors due to their resilient market fundamentals and the natural inflation hedge of rents in most markets. We expect the liquidity of multi-family assets, especially in mature markets like Japan, to be less impacted by tightening financial conditions than unfavored sectors, such as retail and office assets. In China, the nascent domestic REIT market could provide increasing liquidity for multi-family assets, while the liquidity of Australian multi-family assets remains untested as the sector is still emerging. Hotel revenue per available room (RevPAR) has improved in markets that are more advanced in re-opening and have seen material increases in international visitors, such as Australia and Singapore.

UBS Asset Management Weve narrowed it down to A year ago, the world remained in the grips of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Omicron variant had just emerged. 12 months on and the pandemic has largely subsided, only to be replaced by a brutal war in Ukraine and inflation reaching multi-decade highs. This prompted central banks to make aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022, with more expected in 2023, along with a mild recession in the economy. Looking back to our 2022 predictions, in general they proved prescient. We expected hybrid working to weigh on the office market and that the polarization between the best and worst assets would continue, which has been the case. We expected retail capital values to bottom out, which they had started to, but are now likely to be impacted by weakening consumer spending. We said that property investors would no longer be able to rely on market-driven yield compression to drive returns, which has certainly proved accurate as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. In 2023, the environment for real estate looks set to be more challenging, with headwinds coming both from higher interest rates and a weaker economy, which will impact on occupier demand.

Walk around the bustling old port districts of Montreal or Boston or Portland, Maine, and you will find hundreds of for- mer warehouses that have been repurposed into upscale hotels, cool offices, hip restaurants, and distinctive retail spaces. Conversions are hardly limited to old warehouse districts. Every vibrant downtown is filled with buildings of varying types and vintages that have been converted into new uses. Often the conversions go upstream, as lower-value land uses like ware- houses convert into higher-value uses like office or retail. But the direction is often reversed, with old offices converting into artist space or storage.

As logistics tenants are facing elevated transportation and labor costs, we expect outperformance from assets with high-efficiency designs and a balance of favorable accessibility to end users and reasonable rents. Retail fundamentals continue to be affected by e-commerce disruptions, as well as rising inflation and interest rates. Non-discretionary retail in the region is expected to continue to outperform discretionary retail since it is less vulnerable to e-commerce disruptions. Based on our framework for assessing the impact of e-commerce disruptions on brick-and-mortar retail, retail assets in Japan, particularly those catering to non-discretionary spending, could be a relative winner in Asia Pacific in 2023. An aging population lacking digital skills, the hurdle of digital payment implementation and consumers preferences for physical shopping experiences are expected to continue to support brick-and-mortar retail in Japan. Being an unfavored sector, retail bidding participation and transaction volumes have decreased drastically in markets where interest rates have increased."

Yes, we think so. Japans economic recovery has lagged. The labor market improved in 2022, but is still soft relative to 2019. October inflation at 3.6 was the highest in four decades, but modest versus other countries. The pressure was also largely imported while domestic inflation stayed benign. In that context, maintaining the loose monetary policy appears the right thing to do. However, something has to give due to this diverging policy stance versus elsewhere. JPY succumbed to market forces and fell to a 32-year low as a result, putting pressure on the Bank of Japans (BoJ) decision. In reaction, the Ministry of Finance intervened in the FX market for the first time since 1998 to stabilize the currency. Page 4 of 8 The other would focus on fundamentals, and argue that even at a lower entry yield the potential for income growth over the investment period can mitigate some of the value depreciation from rising rates. We would side with the second argument. First, risk should define the yield. This means that assets with a higher risk profile will need to adjust to an even higher yield to maintain a risk premium over more core assets."

As that happens, and especially if projections of cancellations continue to materialize, the supply and affordability challenge will not go away even if the housing market cools for the time being. And, as the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. (CMHC) noted earlier in 2022, the number of new units required to restore reasonable affordability levels is high. Taking into account a number of factors, including income and demographic trends, CMHC estimated that Canada would need to build an additional 3.5 million units to restore housing affordability by 2030. This number is above and beyond the 2.3 million units projected to be built between 2021 and 2030. The findings suggest that the country needs to build a total of 5.8 million homes over that time period, which is a high number considering that, according to CMHCs spring 2022 housing market outlook, there were only about 271,000 housing starts in Canada in 2021. These reports only reinforce the fact that what is truly driving the affordability crisis is a lack of supply and is a signal that Canada does not have the capacity to meet housing demand. Addressing the Supply Issue from All Angles More recent policy discussions and actions have acknowledged what needs to be done to address affordability."

However, trade fair business could remain weak for a more prolonged period, partly due to the loss of the IAA auto show to the Munich trade fair. Frankfurt is a strong retail location with its two prime locations Zeil and Goethestrae as well as several large shopping centres. Another plus point is the fairly moderate decline in prime rents given the negative conditions. By the end of 2021 they had fallen by around 8 per cent to EUR 275 per m2 and have since remained unchanged. Plans for the City of Frankfurt to play an active role in the development of the city centre - some of which is not very attractive - are also positive. A total of EUR 30m is to be invested in city centre projects, with the aim of upgrading the quality of stay. How- ever, retail is also playing a role here. For example, the Galeria store at the entrance to the Zeil has been remodelled into the Weltstadthaus and has been visibly upgraded while remaining open. The former sports arena building which is also close to the Hauptwache is being demolished and will be replaced by 2024 by a modern commercial building with offices.

Stabilization is anticipated to occur in 2024- 2025, with capital growth averaging 1 per annum for the region as a whole during this period. Bouwinvest Outlook 2023-2025 26 Asia Pacific Retail The shopping centre market has also been pressured in the APAC region, but bricks-and-mortar retail in Asia appears to be more resilient relatively speaking than in other parts of the world. First, there is less shopping centre space per head in (emerging) Asian markets than in the U. S. or Europe. Second, the growing middle class in Asia, together with rising wages, are boosting consumer spending and (online) retail sales. Third, Asia has been quick to adopt omni-channel retailing - combining a broad online product offering with high-standard in-store customer service experience - and to include food beverage, entertainment and leisure in its facilities. Modern Asian shopping centres are, moreover, generally built as part of a mixed-use scheme including residential, office and hotels, which ensures footfall and embeds the centre into the community. Finally, climate change and more humid weather conditions have turned shopping centres into preferred meeting places in Hong Kong and Singapore, for example. The region is, however, far more heterogeneous than North America or Europe and some cities and markets, for example in Australia, are experiencing excess supply of shopping centre space."

Presumably, premiums for future interest rate increases were factored in during this phase. There is also discussion about whether the sectoral systemic risk buffer for residential real estate, which increases banks' capital costs, could be removed again. This was introduced in the boom phase to prevent overheating, but now makes lending more expensive and weighs on construction. Due to slightly higher interest rates, but at the same time falling risk premiums, we do not expect 5-10 year mortgage rates to rise further. In February 2023, the interest rate level was 3.6 and this is also our forecast for year-end 2023. However, the high volatility in Bund yields in recent months is likely to persist and could also be transmitted to mortgage rates in the future. We expect a level of 3.8 at year-end 2024. Mortgage lending: New business with only moderate recovery New lending business amounted to around EUR 260 billion in 2022, with the two half-years showing very different trends. In the first banks lend slightly more than EUR 160 billion and after the interest rate shock in the second half of the year less than EUR 100 billion. Our estimation model attributes this decline almost entirely to the rise in interest rates. Consequently, the high economic and political uncertainty had hardly any effect in 2023."

Reflecting on the frightening memories of plummeting values, empty buildings, bankruptcies and the Resolution Trust Corporation , suggests that the current round of credit tightening is likely to pale in comparison. The 2023 edition of LaSalles ISA Outlook anticipates the impacts of the rising cost of credit, a stall in economic growth and a pause in the multi-decade pattern of real estate appreciation. However, it does not extrapolate these trends far into the future. The human tendency to latch onto a few pieces of information and to expect that a narrow set of recent facts will shape future events is known as anchoring bias. When investing in a long-duration asset class like real estate, a longer-term, holistic view is more valuable. In 2014, the apocalyptic visions of German film director, Fritz Langs 1927 masterpiece Metropolis were put alongside the 1960s rock song 2525. The irony of bringing together dark images from one era, while listening to music from another, through the technology of a more recent YouTube artist is symbolic of how imperfectly clever we are at predicting the future."

index_300t_chunks:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!75,21,isa-outlook-2023.pdf," A recession in early 2023 is inevitable in Europe. The cumulative effect of mortgage rate increases and the higher price of goods, services and energy will leave European households and corporates weaker than elsewhere. Weakened currencies could help European exports, but most other economies are slowing too, so it is unlikely to be a salvation for European companies Although households and corporates have higher expectations of government support than at any other time in history, conditioned by experiences since the GFC and the pandemic, sovereign balance sheets are less able than ever to sustain such support. This situation will be even more pronounced in the UK, with its faster time frame for quantitative tightening (QT) allied to its recent chastening by bond markets. The ECB, even once it begins QT of the main balance sheet, will still maintain a spread-control tool allowing for selective purchases of peripheral government debt to set a channel around eurozone sovereign borrowing rates. The relatively limited capacity of European government coffers to support productivity- enhancing investment does, however, offer an opportunity for private sector investors. The removal of the interest rate distortions that were the objective of QE will allow capital allocators to better assess investment projects, hopefully allowing for growing the capital stock rather than inflating speculative asset bubbles. Although the return to more historically typical levels of interest rates will be jarring, the equilibrium state is potentially benign. Europes structural demographic profile suggests a relatively low growth, low inflation, low interest rate long-run equilibrium is in the offing."

Bond yields, which had descended into negative territory over decades, have risen sharply as inflation has climbed. Ten-year Bund yields increased from minus 0.4 per cent last December to nearly 1.8 per cent in June 2022, before slipping back to just over 1.5 per cent by the beginning of September. This has eroded the yield advantage of real estate investment. Although initial rental yields for commercial real estate and residential portfolios have fallen in a similar way to bond yields in recent years, their high yield advantage largely continued until 2021. Furthermore, financing costs for prime properties in the top locations are in some cases higher than the initi- al rental yield, and borrowed capital can no longer therefore be used to raise the total return. Initial rental yields of well below 3 per cent have become less attractive to investors. True, there are signs of an increase in rental yields. However, the willingness of sellers to accept lower purchase prices is limited."

These growth rates were well above the average of 0.5 percent across all census metropolitan areas. We can also see evidence of these trends in international immigration statistics published by Statistics Canada. While international immigration is critical to the continuing growth of Canadas largest cities, it is also true that the share of permanent residents settling in regions like Toronto has been declining over time. Looking at Halifax, which is among the cities we have been watching in recent years for the impacts of changing migration trends, the opposite has happened. Its share of immigrants to Canadas census metropolitan areas rose to 1.4 percent in 20202021 from 0.5 percent in 20012002.

A year ago, key uncertainties surrounding our predictions for moving beyond the acute pandemic phase were around issues like new COVID variants and booster deployment. As for todays economic situation, key uncertainties include:  How long will it take for inflation to come under control? How high must interest rates go in the meantime? There have recently been signs that inflation is peaking, but such hopes could prove fleeting.  How severe an economic slowdown will be required to stabilize in inflation? Will the downturn be steep or shallow? Long or short in duration?  Longer term, will inflation become endemic, remaining sticky at a higher level than observed in recent decades?

Tellingly, the term experiential retail has recently been joined by experiential office, describing a sufficiently uplifting work environment to attract employees out of their home offices and to foster collaboration. If less aggregate office and retail space are needed, it is reasonable to expect demand to be concentrated in the best properties and locations. Merryfield Row San Diego, California Considerations around energy efficiency, net zero carbon and other green credentials are fast becoming the new frontier of the quality divide within sectors. Both tenants and investors are more focused on these traits than ever before. The improving transparency on sustainability matters, as highlighted in the JLLLaSalle Global Real Estate Transparency Index (GRETI)1 suggests that the chasm is likely to widen between assets that deliver and those that do not. We expect the best and most green assets to be easier to let and command higher rents, while also remaining more liquid over the long term. This pattern is likely to affect all property types, but at the moment attention seems particularly focused on the office sector. As a result, we expect that the best office buildingsin terms of both location and building specificationswill perform more strongly than others. Not all regions will move at the same pace in this arena, with Europe leading the way. Looking beyond basic sector labels also reveals potential sources of strength."

As 1994 unfolded, there was still a hangover from the SL debacle. From 1990 to 1993, the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries (NCREIF) Property Index (NPI) had its worst four years since its launch in 1980 . In the UK, the situation was not any better. The new Investment Property Databank (IPD) monthly index registered a boom-bust pattern of returns in the early 1990s, swinging wildly from -18 in 1990 to 35 in 1994 and then plummeting again to zero in 1995 . Out of this crucible came the first ISA, published in early 1995. My research colleagues and I explained that real estate was inherently cyclical. We pointed out that the institutionalization, securitization and globalization of real estate was still in the early stages. And that the professionalization of the investment management business, signaled by the integration of fundamental research, would bring acceptance of the asset class and reduced volatility. Now, nearly 30 years later, we know that real estate recovered from these setbacks. In fact, it thrived."

Perhaps the biggest challenge confronting urban landlords and city leaders is what to do with all that older office space that increasingly looks redundant, obsolete, or both. One of the major problems we have in the office market right now is weve got a bunch of pre-1980 buildings that are function- ally obsolete, and we dont know what we do with them, says the global head of research for an investment management firm. The instinct of many owners will be to upgrade in order to attract new tenants. But that approach can be expensive, with the payoff highly uncertain. Owners of one older high-rise in Boston invested $300 million to convert the 1 million-square-foot con- crete building into a sleek glass-lined tower. Some major leases have been signed, but significant blocks remain available. Not every older building would require such extensive improve- ments to compete for tenants, of course, but even funding tenant improvements may be too risky in this highly competi- tive market. A senior executive with one CRE investment firm believes, Theres going to be a lot of distress. Even in a great market, if their debt is coming due, theyre going to be hard pressed to refinance that building, particularly if that building needs the capital to fit out space, get new building amenities, all the things that are required as table stakes today in leasing office space."

But as we have noted in this report, we are seeing divides within sectors widen and joining the divides between sectorsso care in selecting the right locations and markets is essential. Investment approaches that structure around uncertainty are those where the investor acknowledges value uncertainty, but the investments have characteristics such that outcomes are not dependent on resolving that uncertainty in a specific way. Senior and junior lending at defensible attachment points are thus attractive today, especially given the widening in debt pricing and if in floating-rate constructs. Structuring contractual features into equity investments that insulate investment outcomes from key uncertainties can also be effective. Finally, investors are wise to identify strategies that take advantage of market dislocation. For example, we see opportunities in the heavily repriced listed real estate markets and expect to see them in the indirect space as secondary fund interests find price discovery. We also recommend positioning to acquire assets at distressed pricing in markets being hit most by capital pricing and availability challenges, such as Europe."

If the climate targets in the building sector are missed by a significant margin over the entire decade, the regulatory framework could be tightened, for example by setting a maximum value for the green asset ratio.

In our main scenario, we therefore also assume slightly falling prime rents for the coming year. In 2024, too, the downside risk outweighs the growth opportunities for rents in view of further rising vacancy rates. This could change from 2025 onwards, because the current environment of high financing and construction costs will lead to significantly fewer project developments being started. There could then be a lack of new construction space, at least, and this could lead to rising rents in the prime segment. Logistics markets Private households and the manufacturing sector are suffering particularly from the current and foreseeable macroeconomic environment. The former are facing a massive real loss of purchasing power due to high inflation and will have to reduce their consumption. The latter will be squeezed by rising energy costs and lower global demand. If fewer goods are bought as well as produced, this puts a double burden on the demand for logistics space. After rising to record levels until recently, take-up is expected to fall in 2023. A rising number of insolvencies, especially among small and medium-sized enterprises, could also lead to higher vacancy rates in the small-space segment. In addition, online retail, which was a massive demand driver especially in the last two years, is experiencing a setback. This was to be expected anyway after the pandemic- related boom. It is now being exacerbated by high inflation."

They should come back to more of a long-term historical average of 3 percent to 4 percent, and maybe offset some of the unafford- ability in the country. Indeed, housing markets may be partly victims of their own success as record prices and rents mean fewer households can afford to buy homes or rent apartments, particularly with mort- gage interest rates and housing-related expenses like utilities 6 rising sharplya topic we explore in Too Much for Too Many, our trend on housing affordability. The Amazon Pause The white-hot industrial market also seems set to cool after sev- eral years of unprecedented demand growth and rent gains that have pushed rents far above prior records. Growth in e-com- merce is slowing and giving back some of the market share it captured from physical retailers during the pandemic.

For example, owners who are forced to sell assets because they are unable to refinance debt or need to sell for other reasons, such as generating liquidity quickly. In such situations, sellers may be willing to accept below-market prices, or indeed have to, in order to facilitate a sale. For investors wanting to deploy capital now, holding off for a few months as pricing adjusts is probably the best strategy. Given the higher interest rate environment, we also think that floating rate real estate debt is an attractive way to achieve strong inflation protected returns and generate a good income return from real estate. Finally, looking across the globe, another potential opportunity for investors in 2023 is Japan, due to accretive hedging gains for investment into this market. Indeed, investors need to be mindful of large differences in monetary policy as interest rate differentials between countries determine the cost of hedging. Currently, Japan is particularly attractive on an after-hedging basis, since interest rates there are lower than in other markets. Page 3 of 8 What opportunities exist for investors in 2023? Which markets and sectors are the most defensive? There are two schools of thought in answering this question."

Higher yielding assets generally come from sectors with weak occupational demand, hence the risk of void periods and negative rental growth are much higher, particularly during a period of economic stress. Sectors including life sciences, student accommodation, cold storage logistics and self- storage where there are strong structural drivers to support rental growth, are expected to see the greatest value protection. This was welcome news for markets. While unlikely to change the JPY direction, we take comfort that both the government and the BoJ are on the same page. First, this helps to buy time until the US Fed softens its hawkish stance. Second, there is also a positive implication that the next BoJ governor due to be appointed in April 2023 will not deviate materially. To be clear, an exit from the ultra-loose policy is possible in the medium-term. However, it will most likely be done in a gradual manner. For 2023, at least, the current policy should stay and the chances are even higher now that the peak of global inflation and interest rates are drawing close."

However, this additional burden is to be largely offset by a reduction in VAT on gas from 19 to 7 per cent during the same pe- riod. The explosion in heating bill is not just affecting those homes which are heated with gas. The price of oil, wood pellets and electricity needed to run heat pumps has also risen sharply. Natural gas, though, is by far the most widely used source of heating since it is used in over half of homes in Germany. The advantages of a gas heating system are a lower initial outlay, small space requirement, reliability and, hitherto low energy costs. These advantages have meant that, until now, gas heating systems were so much in demand and that around four times more were installed (650,000) in 2021, than more environmentally friendly heat pumps . This meant that gas boilers had a market share of 70 per cent last year . Gas continued to dominate, even in the first half of 2022. As previously, gas boilers made up the lion's share of a total of 463,000 new heating installations at around 300,000 units, followed in second place by heat pumps at 96,000. The rapid rise in gas, oil, wood and electricity prices means that bills for running a home are now of much greater concern for tenants, owner-occupiers and landlords alike."

The economic dip will dampen demand for space in the commercial property markets and vacancy rates will mostly rise. Consequently, downward pressure on rents will increase. Due to increased demands and high inflation, space will nevertheless remain scarce and expensive for occupiers. This is even more true for flats. be different. But what is the value of such an outlook if the present - shaken by pandemic, war and other catastrophes - is already barely comprehensible? Well, precisely because the future is unusually open, it requires a sharp look at recent developments to be able to limit this openness. The fact that everything could be different than before does not mean that everything is possible. With this in mind, we would like to share our observations on the German real estate market here and, based on them, set out a frame of reference for what we think market players might expect in the coming years. Macro environment The omnipresent uncertainty among real estate market players is no coincidence. The markets are confronted with a macro environment that is unique in this constellation. This starts with inflation, which has not been as high as it is at present since the 1970s. But above all, weakening economic momentum coincides with rising interest rates ."

Capital values are expected to weaken further, despite signals that the bottom of the market may have already been reached. Neighbourhood and food- anchored retail centres (convenience) in growing catchment areas are better placed and continue to perform well. Niches Institutional real estate investors are expected to continue their gradual and managed shift from core, traditional real estate sec- tors to more investments in niche and growth market segments. The European healthcare market, for example, is viewed as being fundamentally well-positioned due to ageing societies and increased life expectancy in most European countries. Supply shortfalls characterise both the senior housing market and nursing homes . The market is becoming increasingly professional through the financial support of institutional investors and the growing experience and expertise of local operators, pointing to enormous potential for investment opportunities in this niche segment. Long leases offer inflation protection while the yield gap between regular residential investments and senior housing, in particular, is still quite significant, offering opportunities for future value growth. Student housing is also seen as an attractive niche segment, especially during this current period of economic uncertainty and or recession, due to a growing influx of students combined with low supply levels. Demand for student housing has been relatively inelastic compared to GDP movement in the past and that situation is not expected to change."

Investment markets Looking back at the year 2022, the real estate investment market was primarily characterised by the interest rate shock. The steep turnaround in interest rates triggered a price correction on the real estate markets from the spring onwards, whereby the uncertainty about the extent and duration of the correction led to many investors temporarily withdrawing from the market. The turnaround in interest rates now appears to be largely complete and on this basis, we believe that a reliable price level should re-emerge on the real estate markets in the course of 2023, possibly as early as the spring. At what level buyers and sellers will come together remains to be seen. We are convinced that the 200 to 250 basis point rise in interest rates will not translate one-to-one into initial property yields."

Where People Live The pandemic brought massive migration across the United States as people reevaluated where they wanted to live based on cost, weather, community, and family. Builders noted the large number of Californians who moved to Florida, and also took note of apartment dwellers becoming homebuyers because they wanted yards. A large private builder in the South experienced the same and furthermore found that new in-migrants had suf- ficient cash for larger homes and more upgrades.

And overall affordability pressures are affecting other classes of residential real estate as rising interest rates and the resulting challenges faced by homebuyers in qualifying for financing under the mortgage stress test push many potential purchasers to try to rent a home instead. But with supply also constrained and getting even tighter in the rental market, rising rents are adding to the growing affordability crisis. While the RBCs report noted that worsening affordability condi- tions would be particularly marked in relatively high-priced markets like Toronto and Vancouver, the challenges have been spreading across Canada as Canadians increasingly move to other communitieslike suburbs and evolving 18-hour cities as well as small towns and rural areasin search of cheaper places to live. Migration away from Canadas largest cities which still tend to see population increases as a result of high rates of international immigrationhas been a trend for some time, but the growth of remote working during the pandemic has exacerbated the move outwards and helped make affordability pressures more widespread. We can see the impacts in annual population estimates published earlier in 2022 from Statistics Canada.

Finding an obsolete office building at the right price and asking rents, with high vacancy and the right floor plates to convert into an apartment building is great in theory, but hard to execute in todays market. New Phase for Offices It may be a clich, but the pandemic exposed cracks and exac- erbated trends as much as started them. Dissatisfaction with offices did not start in 2020. Worker satisfaction was at an all- time low in 2019 because of factors such as densification, small workspaces, and mismanaged seating. Job one is to correct what was broken in the workplace, said the office consultant. We need to get the topic out of cocktail banter and into science of how to create the best outcomes. The key for office owners is to focus on facilitating the productiv- ity of tenants workforces by improving the health, safety, and functionality of buildings. I think we who are now in the real estate industry must realize we are no longer selling a product but selling a service, said one analyst. Those are different beasts. Any real estate investor that is not taking seriously the possibility that the market is being fundamentally upended is going to get a real shock. Office owners must understand the customer like never before. If not, they will have a problem."

In Japan, debt costs have moved far less than in other parts of the world, as inflation remains subdued and the Bank of Japan continues to exercise yield curve control . By contrast, Europes real estate yield starting point was exceptionally low and market interest rates have moved up much more markedly, making the math that much more impactful. Government policy also matters. As central banks seek to choke off inflation by tightening monetary policy, there is at least the reasonable expectation that some of that inflation will be passed into rents and thus property cash flows. But when governments employ long-term borrowing to bail out energy consumers in the short term, as is necessary in Europe, interest rates are pushed up further and the impact on property values may be more detrimental. As the UKs recent experience would suggest, credit markets can react swiftly to reflect changes in perceived debt sustainability.

Investors have followed suit. A similar divergence is taking place in the hotel sector but through a very different dynamic. Here, the divide is being driven by the contrast between the broad post-COVID recov- ery in the leisure market and the much slower and incomplete business market recovery. Thus, resorts and destination hotels are commanding record revenue while many convention and business hotels languish. And then there is office, where tenants are increasingly choos- ing newer, more modern buildings and abandoning everything else, especially pre-1990 buildings. Unfortunately, for current owners, the office sector experienced its greatest construction boom in the 1980s. Now, many of those assets are becoming functionally obsolete, unwanted by tenants or investors. Says a senior leader of a global development firm, If its old class B office, Id be worried because thats the kind of space that companies will ultimately shed to move into new space. But not just any new space. The top tier of spacewhich industry experts say accounts for only about 20 percent of all office stockis distinguished by several key modern design features.

Bottom formation will be near if interest rate rises end soon We expect prices to fall by a further 2 in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter. Subsequently, prices should pick up again slightly. The starting signal for this could be more cautious communication by the ECB with regard to further interest rate hikes and a continued cautious approach to reducing bond purchases. As a result, mortgage rates should also fall again, uncertainty among investors should decrease noticeably and the positive price drivers should take over. In many respects, the historical model for current developments is the 1970s. Then, too, there were energy crises, high wage settlements, loose fiscal policy, and wars. In that decade average inflation increased by 5 annually and house prices by 6. If by 2030 house prices were again to increase at 1 point above inflation, and assuming an average inflation rate of 3 annually, then house prices would increase by 4 annually. Rental growth is expected to be similar, so initial rental yields would run sideways at today's levels. In this scenario, rental yields remain at their current level of 3.7. The housing market would remain attractive in this scenario, but in addition to the higher financing costs, refurbishment costs, CO2 levies and the like would have to be paid from the yields. We no longer expect the sometimes exorbitant returns of the boom phase from the financial crisis to the beginning of 2022."

In this respect, it could be that lenders in many cases are aiming for a speedy redemption of loans. In addition to refinancing issues, there are other reasons for an increasing number of sales. For example, the devaluation of equities and bonds may have led to real estate quotas above target in some portfolios. This could trigger sales. Liquidity bottlenecks in open-end funds due to cash outflows could also make sales necessary. Against this backdrop and based on our observation that the number of sales processes started has already risen in recent weeks, we expect more supply again in perspective than recently. The big unknown is how much demand this supply will be matched by. In principle, many investment managers and other capital collection agencies still have plenty of money to invest, and capital sources such as insurance companies and pension institutions are continuously receiving more money to invest. However, the trend in recent years of more and more of this money flowing into the real estate markets may have been broken with the turnaround in interest rates. The artificially low interest rates have made the money and bond market unattractive for many years. In addition, central banks have squeezed private investors out of the market with their securities purchase programmes and forced them to invest their money elsewhere, including in real estate."

For this reason, the number of office workers in Germany could decline in the next few years after a steady rise until now. However, the trend in the seven biggest cities could be more favourable in view of their function as major economic centres. It might be possible to combine management and development functions in those cities in view of a better availability of skilled workers there. In addition, in the next few years, demand for office space could be influenced by New Work concepts. Employees in many companies and institutions are allowed to work remotely  mostly from home. Many are taking advantage of this option with great enthusiasm, which means that workers are now spending only roughly half their working hours in the office. Accordingly, the number of desks can be reduced substantially in relation to the past when workers spent five days in the office. The impact on the amount of office space required, however, is less than the reduction in office presence. Companies are having to factor in peak presence times so that no- body wishing to work in the office has to go back home to work because of a lack of desks. After all, a high presence rate is desirable for good communication. Additional space is also needed for meetings and for concentration."

Comparison of office markets in top locations There was little sign of any crisis in the top locations' office markets in the first half. The Covid-led dip in take-up has been largely ironed out by a bounce-back in de- mand for office space since the end of 2021. Take-up in Q2 2022 rose to over 1 mil- lion m2  a figure only exceeded seven times in the 50 quarters since 2010. The ear- lier uptick in vacancies has been brought to a halt by an increase in letting activity. Overall, the vacancy rate rose by 1.5 percentage points to around 4.5 per cent on the back of the pandemic, but as such remains fairly low. Whereas there was a more pronounced variation in the vacancy rate between the seven top locations in the past, two camps have now emerged. At 8 per cent, the vacancy rate in Dsseldorf and Frankfurt is roughly twice that of the five other loca- tions which have figures of 3 to 4 per cent. Prior to Covid, Berlin, Munich and Stuttgart had the lowest vacancy rates. Most recently, though, they have been beat- en by Cologne with a figure of 2.8 per cent."

But these recent volumes do not tell the whole storyand the story they do tell may be misleading as to where property markets seem to be heading. Discussions with numerous participants from all corners of the industry confirm that many investors have moved to the sidelinesor to other types of assets like equities and bonds. Indeed, the recent surge may well reflect a last gasp to get deals done before the expected increase in interest rates. Fewer Investors Fewer investors and lenders will be providing capital for assets, according to this years Emerging Trends survey: expectations of availability declined for every one of the 13 equity and debt capital sources. Over the past decade, CRE markets benefited from a substantial capital inflow as alternative investment classes have gained wider acceptance and real estate offered compel- ling risk-adjusted returns.

Most notable are different approaches to prefabricated and modular housing in which much or all of the house is built in a factory and then assembled on the homesite. These methods can dramatically reduce the need for labor and shrink production times at more affordable costs. Promising innovations are also arising from the nascent single-fam- ily build-to-rent sector, which is learning how to scale construction and design to reduce costs and development time, as explained in our single-family sector overview found in chapter 2. Government could also expand affordable housing produc- tion. Unfortunately, Congress dropped the affordable housing components of the proposed Build Back Better Act from what became the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, meaning that no additional federal help is on the way. But many state and local governments are stepping into the breach, as we discuss in our final trend on regulation. In the end, perhaps the most effective solution is the most obvi- ous: we must construct more housing that is affordable to more people. As the former homebuilder we quoted earlier puts it, what is needed is a new way of getting housing out there and get it built more affordably. 15 5."

Wealth tends to be concentrated in larger urban centres with better employment opportunities where the average age of the working population is lower than in regional and more remote communities. Demand for living assets remains strong in most urbanised areas due to demographic growth and the rising number of households, boosted by immigration and the expanding number of younger and older people living alone. The volume of new housing developments is also falling due to increasingly stringent environmental rules, shortages of materials and rising labour costs. Demand continues to outstrip supply, especially in the affordable segment. If the number of new-build projects continues to decline, the valuations of existing stock may hold up relatively well. Increases in mortgage rates mean home ownership will move out of reach of a growing group of people, forcing them to turn to the rental market for accommodation that fits their budgets. Residential real estate is seen as a relatively good inflation hedge as most rental contracts are index-linked but, in our view, it will not be possible to pass on the full level of consumer price rises to tenants. Governments in many countries are implementing measures to offset energy price hikes or cap rental increases to support the purchasing power of people living in social housing and other low- to middle-income tenants. Rising 10-year government bond yields will simultaneously pressure spread levels and yields will move out."

Even if affordability eventually improves with falling housing prices, the reality is that the key issue underpinning the crisis is insufficient sup- ply to meet high demand for all types of homes. Demand will continue to rise, especially as the Canadian government com- mits to higher immigration targets in the coming years and the country welcomes large numbers of temporary residents, like international students, who also need places to live. This means that even as homebuilding activity has been rising, tight market conditions have put pressures on affordability that are unlikely to ease significantly."

The hedonic price indices are thus rising more strongly or falling less. The sharp price declines in the non-hedonic price indices are evidently also due to the fact that it is primarily properties of lower quality that are changing hands. The vdp indices which are calculated exclusively on a hedonic basis confirm this statement. These indices which are published quarterly only began to fall in the second half of the year. In the metropolitan areas , apartments, single- family houses and multi-family houses fell by around 3 from their high point in the second quarter. Nationwide, prices for both single-family houses and condominiums were down by only around 1 . These indices thus also support our expectation that prices will ease only slightly. In the course of 2023, the focus is likely to be on the transaction-based indices of Europace and vdp. The hedonic indices are likely to provide a better basis for assessing developments in the coming months. In the case of the Europace indices, another methodological detail is important. They are based on moving averages. For example, the value in March is an average of transactions from January to March."
index_300t_chunks:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!154,61,Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf," The sector has also been shifting to a retail mind- set, where hospital systems and providers look to attract new patients and build market share in new areas, contributing to the increased demand for high-quality medical space. Tenants of medical office buildings tend to sign much longer lease terms than tenants of other types of commer- cial real estatesometimes up to 15 or 20 yearsand are much more likely to renew since moving too far away would jeopardize their local patient market share. This patientpro- vider dynamic and the increasing demand for space have resulted in remarkably stable performance across the sector. Renewal rates in the medical office sector are typically 80 percent or more and rent growth is very steady, typically ranging between 2 and 3 percent per year. These dynamics also translate into a long-term stable occupancy trend. Even in the wake of the financial crisis of 20082009, occupancy never fell below 90 percent. After the pandemic-related shut- downs, physician employment recovered remarkably fast and, despite the sudden halt of many services for a period, renewal rates increased. Investors have also been shifting their view of the sec- tor. Whereas previously it was considered so niche an investment that only specialists would invest in it, it is now recognized for how insulated it is and how resilient it is during market cycles.

index_300t_chunks:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!100,27,isa-outlook-2023.pdf," Avoiding and taking advantage of volatility A well-tested strategy for investing during a period of economic weakness and negative market sentiment is to identify assets that will be durable against disruption. In the US, this often points towards medical office. This sector has steady demand that is largely uncorrelated with the economic cycle. Long- leased properties in other property types, such as industrial, can also cushion the impact of economic disruptions and provide stable cash flow, but valuations can still move with rent volatility and changing capital market assumptions. Grocery-anchored retail properties can also provide cash flow durability, but the level of stability depends on the share of the income from the grocer anchor and the health of its business. On the flip side, volatility can create opportunities through changingand even uncertainpricing. This requires investors to have a clear guide on value, outlook and flexibility. The idiosyncratic nature of private real estate means pricing is never completely transparent, but active market participants often have a good sense for property value based on past trades. However, historical comparables have less meaning when pricing is shifting. This means that investors must have an internal view on value, either through a required returnfair value framework, comparisons to replacement costs, absolute return targets or a combination of all of these. Sellers also lack a clear guide to value and might be motivated to sell even when a bid does not meet expectations. An informed investor can bid decisively when attractive value opportunities emerge, even in out-of- favor sectors."

At the same time, pressure to take action in this respect is being eased not least by successful home working. After all, employees can work well from home, even without new office space. In view of a persistently tight supply of modern office space, prime rents are unlikely to come down, in spite of the expected weak- ness in the market. Instead, they should remain largely stable. Since office space under construction is mostly already pre-let, the postponement of planned office pro- jects could even lead to a greater shortage still of contemporary office space on the back of the rise in construction in financing costs. In weaker market conditions, how- ever, vacancies overall could increase, although this would probably affect primarily outdated offices. Overall, interest in office properties with low energy efficiency is likely to wane among tenants and investors alike. Demand for modern office space remains intact though and, as illustrated by the trend in the first half of 2022, should therefore pick up again once economic condi- tions improve and the crisis-led uncertainty recedes. Until then, we could see a ra- ther unusual trend in rents where existing rents could rise faster than new leases through inflation-indexed leases."

The low number of working days required to connect buildings to the district heating network is equally optimistic. Typically, four working days are needed for single-family homes and six for multi-family buildings. High political and social pressure on cities and municipalities to meet the district heating target is also likely to divert many resources to this area. The number of heat pumps is even expected to quadruple, from around 1.5 million at present to around 6 million by 2030. This is also particularly ambitious because the installation of a heat pump in a single-family house currently typically takes two weeks. According to the estimates made in the study, achieving the heat pump targets will require the working time of around 50,000 full-time equivalents. In 2022, there were about 190,000 employees subject to social insurance contributions working in the plumbing, heating, and air conditioning industry, according to the Labor Department's 2010 occupational classification. Almost all of them work full-time and 180,000 are skilled workers. The number of skilled workers in the heating sector alone cannot be determined from the occupational classification. Assuming 100,000 skilled workers in the heating sector, about half of the employees would have to install heat pumps in the future. To retrain every second employee on a new technology would undoubtedly be challenging."

Accordingly, long-term benchmark interest rates such as 10-year Bund yields are also relevant for mortgage loans. In the course of 2023, in the absence of further supply shocks, the high energy and commodity prices of 2022 will have a diminishing impact on inflation. Therefore, price pressures are likely to subside. However, inflation is likely to remain above the 2 target for some time. Therefore, the ECB started to reduce its nearly EUR 5,000 billion bond holdings as of March 2023. Initially, however, this is likely to raise capital market rates only slightly, as the holdings will be reduced by only EUR 15 billion per month from March to June. The ECB is therefore acting very cautiously. Consequently, the pressure on Bund yields is relatively low in our base scenario. We expect Bund yields to peak at 2.85 in the course of the year and at 2.65 at year-end. Consequently, mortgage rates are also likely to rise somewhat. Once the interest rate peak is foreseeable, uncertainty and the risk premium should fall. From 2003 to 2014, the spread between 10-year Bund yields and 5-10-year mortgage rates averaged 105 basis points. As long as the ECB bought bonds and their yields fell, spreads increased."

Up until the end of 2021, property buyers benefited from mortgage rates which were at times below 1 per cent. In spite of high purchase prices, it was largely possible to part finance a flat or home from the rent saved from a comparable property. Mortgage rates have since risen to over 3 per cent, which means that lending rates are much higher, and therefore the option to buy a home is mostly only affordable for households with a large capital. This is leading to rising demand for rental property, as is already clear from internet searches on property websites."

However, we do not have these data in disaggregated form. As we have shown for the German housing stock as a whole, demolitions are negligible for Germany. Vacancy data makes it easier to define market equilibria. As a proxy we assume that equilibrium existed in 2011. For most cities this is probably reasonable. Exceptions are certainly some large metropolises, especially Munich with very low vacancy rates already at the beginning of the cycle. From an analytical point of view, a better time to define an equilibrium is the start of the cycle in 2009, but due to the strong correction of the population by the 2011 census, we choose 2011 as the starting point. 9 April 21, 2023 Germany Monitor 2023 Housing market outlook 1990-2030 Household size 21 Persons per household 2.30 2.10 1.90 1.70 600 400 200 0 -200 -400 126 101 76 50 25 0 90 94 98 02 06 10 14 18 22 26 30 A B C D cities Sources: bulwiengesa, Deutsche Bank Research 2012-2030 Residential supply vs. demand 22 No."

Resilient consumption supported demand for logistics real estate through the first half of 2022, requiring more space to move goods quickly and hold higher inventories. The urgency to secure more space, paired with delays in supply and rising replacement costs, pushed rents to historic highs while vacancies fell to record lows. At the same time, capital market dynamics began to shift, marked by repricing and a pullback in volume. E-Commerce Holds Strong, Despite a Return to In-Store Shopping Consumer spending patterns returned to in-store shopping as local economies reopened, but the future of retail still relies on e-commerce. Why? Because consumers prefer the conve- nience and choice of shopping online. The number of people who used same- or next-day delivery held steady in 2021 dur- ing the holiday season, compared with a decrease in people who purchased goods online and picked them up in store. And e-commerce supply chains are being built to accommo- date faster delivery timetables, which attracts sales because consumers appreciate the speed. More than 90 percent of con- sumers expect delivery in three days or fewer, and 30 percent expect same-day delivery."

Logistics and housing are among them. From the point of view of most occupiers, space will therefore remain scarce and expensive, especially since the initially still high inflation will eat up any savings in cold rent through higher costs elsewhere. In view of this dynamic, risk-taking investors and those for whom real estate is an investment that needs to be actively managed are likely to get their moneys worth in 2023. Asset management could become the buzzword of the year. In view of the major trends of digitalisation and decarbonisation, it could well be not just a year, but an era of asset management. But that is a topic for another outlook. Conclusion Despite all the uncertainty, one thing seems certain in our view for the real estate year 2023: it will remain challenging for all market players. Investors will be busy digesting the interest rate turnaround for at least the first few months. And many occupiers will increasingly feel the effects of the economic downturn. Letting-related issues will thus also come more to the fore for landlords in the course of the year. However, not only cyclical but also structural changes will keep the market in motion."

Lab requirements also differ. Analysis by JLL differentiates between wet and dry labs, and biological and chemical wet labs. The requirements for a dry lab are fairly moderate, for example similar to utility rooms. The costs are therefore only slightly higher than for office space. The requirements for wet labs are considerably higher because they involve the use of chemicals and special analytical equipment. These include, for example, higher ceilings, special surfaces, and powerful extraction and ventilation systems for gases and liquids.

Our recent report, How to Choose, Use and Better Understand Climate Risk Analytics, researched and written in partnership with the Urban Land Institute (ULI), is an excellent overview of the challenges faced by first-time consumers of climate data. The paper outlines physical climate risk basics, identifies differences between data providers to be aware of and raises a call to action to standardize the outputs in ways that are most meaningful and useful for real estate, with transparency that enables apples-to-apples comparisons across models. G LO BA L Not all of 2022s dramatic events were meteorological. Some were geopolitical. The shutdown of natural gas flows from Russia to Europe drove a severe spike in energy prices in that region. European commercial tenants have begun to put pressure on landlords to address increasing energy expenses passed through to them under net leases, asking them to cap service charges, defer contractual rent increases and improve the buildings energy efficiency. Occupiers in Europe now actively shop for space looking for an acceptable total occupancy cost, including both rent and energy costs, putting direct downward pressure on rents for energy-inefficient buildings. This exposes landlords to energy costs as if the lease contracts were gross leases, no matter what the lease may actually say. Efficiency improvements, electrification and on-site power generation are cornerstones of decarbonization strategies."

Accordingly, the rental activity only affects part of the laboratory building stock. This probably explains - in contrast to the office market - why the proportion of owner-occupiers in the leases for rented laboratory properties considered by JLL is in the low single-digit percentage range. The rental agreements are usually for periods of ten years plus an extension option. Companies in the early phases prefer shorter terms because their prospects are uncertain. This flexibility is mainly evident in science and technology parks. Expansion and renovati- on costs are much higher than for offices. Depending on the agreement, these costs may be borne by the tenant or may be reflected in a correspondingly higher rent."

They had been characterized by a broad trend of gradual improvement interrupted by variant- related setbacks, but leveled off as of mid-2022, as shown in Exhibit G.7. Given that COVID-related restrictions are mostly gone, further normalization in the balance of in-person and virtual modalities will have to rely on changes in company policy and the possible influence of a recession on workplace culture.

The e-commerce share of retail sales shot up from 13 percent in 2019 to a peak of 20 percent during the initial national lockdown. That drained a lot of spending from physical retailers and squeezed the nations shopping centers. The online share inevitably waned as the economy reopened and more consumers felt comfortable shopping in stores again. But dont expect online spending to drop down to pre-pandemic levels, say many experts we interviewed. While shoppers initially resorted to e-commerce due to safety concerns or simply because the stores were not even opendid we really live through that?they still shop online today because of its other benefits, including greater convenience, selection, and price advantages. Thus, the share we spend online remains highly elevated at just under 18 percent, nearly five percentage points above the rate before COVID. 7 Where will it go from here? The fate of shopping centers and physical retailers hangs on the answer, with downstream impacts on warehouses and logistics. The retail property sector fared far better during and since the pandemic than anyone could have expected, benefiting from both direct government assistance to retailers and the stimulus payments to households, who could keep spending, even if out of work.

All this growth is bringing big-city problems to some smaller, vibrant markets that Emerging Trends once described all-inclu- sively as 18-hour cities. Such problems include those that affect the quality of life and standard of living . These side effects to unfettered growth bring to mind the old joke about the hot restaurant that is so popular that no one wants to go there anymore. The Sun Belt markets are still strong population and business magnets, but they may now draw fewer and different people as their appeal changes. Becoming a 24-Hour City Though still ranked among the highest of all markets, some high-flying Sun Belt metros declined in ratings this year. Housing is more expensive, traffic is getting worse, longtime residents are getting frustrated, and even some newcomers are finding the proverbial grass to be not quite as green as they envisioned. In focus groups with local market experts conducted by ULI district councils across the United States, participants from the Supernovas and some other Sun Belt markets were likelier than members from metro areas with more sluggish economies to cite issues like living costs, housing affordability, and infrastruc- ture quality as being a regional disadvantage. These issues were most frequently mentioned as problems in some of the booming markets, like Austin and Nashville."
index_300t_chunks:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!56,22,Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf," The notion of converting obsolete malls into fulfillment centers, for example, has been a point of interest by both people inside and outside the real estate industry. But the case for these conversions can be easy to exaggerate. Nearby residents dont relish sharing local roads with big-rig trucks serv- ing these logistics facilities, while local governments resist losing retail sales tax revenue and jobs. And everyone laments losing what had been a community gathering place. But the greatest barrier to land use conversions is the value loss that owners must recognize in order to justify transformative investment and make projects feasible. Malls, for example, often command the highest values per square foot of any property type and warehouses among the lowest: converting a mall into a warehouse may require an enormous value writedown. It is possible to convert malls to uses with higher values than warehouses. For example, the Austin Community College con- verted Highland Mall into a mixed-use campus, while Amazon purchased the former Lord Taylor flagship store in Manhattan, aiming to convert the building into offices, though those plans have since been frozen as Amazon reevaluates its space needs. An even more likely step for failing malls is to convert just the most problematic portions. For example, at York Galleria in York, Pennsylvania, a former Sears was converted into a casino and then a vacant Bon-Ton department store into a self-storage facility."

It is also important to think about compensation and incentives, which an increasing number of organizations are doing by tying executive pay to progress on inclusion and diversity metrics. For the real estate sector, this will likely be an area where there will be a need for industry associations to take a leading role in attracting and developing a more diverse workforce for compa- nies to recruit from. 3. Housing Affordability: A Challenging Issue for Canada and a Significant Concern for Real Estate Companies In no jurisdiction in the world has affordable housing been solved with no incentives. A key social issue for real estate, of course, is housing afford- ability. Housing costs and availability ranked as the top social political issue among survey respondents this year, and it comes as no surprise as affordability matters continued to rise and reached crisis levels in some areas of Canada in 2022. We can see the evidence in RBC Economics housing affordability index report, which showed that ownership costs as a percent- age of median household income reached 59.3 percent for single-family homes at the start of 2022. Moves by the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates as part of its bid to tackle inflation are having an impact on home prices."

The connection between the property and the u- ser is much closer than in the case of residential, office and retail real estate where rental agreements are generally standardised and tenants can be changed without any problem. Despite the growth potential in this segment, the risk is therefore heigh- tened - particularly for properties outside the life science cluster - if there is a change of tenant or the tenant experiences difficulties. As the Covid pandemic has demonst- rated, even after the start-up phase and initial success there can certainly be set- backs here. In addition to BioNTech in Mainz, CureVac in Tbingen was also work- ing at full speed to develop a mRNA-based Covid 19 vaccine. However, BioNTech had the edge, which has benefited its shareholders and also in particular the city of Mainz."
index_300t_chunks:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!7,2,isa-outlook-2023.pdf," The forces of nationalism, authoritarianism and a distrust of globalism may represent a temporary triumph of politics over economics. Over the long term, though, the power of open markets remains a force to be reckoned with and not to be underestimated. Likewise, well-constructed and well-located properties can thrive even during periods of great political turmoil. Successful real estate investing rests on identification of timeless attributes that are successful over the course of several cycles. These attributes must be appropriately priced and they must also adapt to trends in demographics, technology, urbanization and environmental factors. This triangle of timelessness, adaptation and fair value pricing forms the foundation for successful real estate investing. As I hand over the reins of LaSalles research to a new generation of researchers, I sense that the past, present and future will continue to intersect and to overlap. The awarding of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Economics was based in part on an analysis of the Great Depression of the 1930s. We have learned much about credit cycles and the role of banks in maintaining or losing confidence in market institutions. At the same time, the events of 2022 in Ukraine and elsewhere show how unpredictable the course of human events can be. The semi-predictable path of rising C02 levels is leading to weather volatility along with rising atmospheric and oceanic temperatures."

But instead, there is a general sense of wary optimism, though not without considerable concern about the direction of the overall economy. A Shift from Structural to Cyclical Challenges Not surprisingly, when market participants were asked about the greatest challenges facing retail ahead, economic conditions garnered the most responses. Oversupply and e-commerce followed, but we should note that those issues consistently led survey responses in recent years. Obviously, we are all hyper- focused on the economy right now, one top real estate analyst told us. But for years, the biggest challenges to retail real estate have been deep structural ones related to e-commerce. The question now is whether the pandemic accelerated a lot of those changes, with much pain, and if we are past the worst of the disruptions. This shift in mind-set may be difficult to understand for those accustomed to the popular pre-pandemic narrative of retail apocalypse. It reflects not just the depth of the challenges the sector has faced, but the strength of the reboundalbeit an uneven onethat has been taking place since 2021. As one institutional landlord put it, Retail has always had to adapt faster than other property types, simply because the consumer space is always evolving, and it is doing so at a faster pace than ever."

At a time when financing is both less available and more expensive, companies with a strong ESG track record will have an advantage in attracting investment from institutional players and sourcing new forms of capitalsuch as green bonds and sustainability-linked loansthat continue to grow in Canada. While many Canadian real estate players have responded by increasing their focus on ESG strategies, expectations continue to rise in key areas, including when it comes to having robust com- mitments to address climate change. As we have seen in other areas of the world, investors are increasingly looking beyond whether a company has an ESG strategy to ask about plans to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. And if a company does not have a net-zero strategy, they wont invest. But while Canadian real estate players can expect to start seeing similar requirements from their own investors, our interviewees showed that some companies have yet to fully embrace the net-zero imperative. According to PwCs 2022 global CEO Survey, just 19 percent of real estate executives said that their organization had made a commitment to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. For some real estate companies, the temptation remains to be fast followers rather than leaders on matters like achieving net-zero emissions. One interviewee, for example, told us that they were waiting for other companies to do the heavy lifting on exploring and investing in the right technology investments to address ESG matters in real estate before following suit them- selves."

As one interviewee told us, avoiding obsolescence as a result of a build- ings carbon profile will be increasingly important for real estate owners, as will the upsides of having green properties that are more attractive to lenders, tenants, and buyers. A willingness to look at retrofitting buildings will also be key since avoiding emissions associated with new construction will be a critical part of the industrys contribution to achieving climate change goals. Measuring the S Factor an Emerging ESG Focus for Canadian Real Estate Companies While climate change issues remain a major focus of the ESG agenda, concern about social issues was an emerging issue for interviewees this year. An important consideration for many How, for example, do companies compare to their peers on mat- ters like workforce representation, diversity at senior ranks, and pay equity? As employees, community members, and, in some cases, regulators increasingly look for data in these and other areas, real estate companies will need to have good processes in place to produce it. But as PwC Canada found in its 2022 analy- sis of ESG reporting practices of large public companies, many Canadian organizations have gaps in this area. The report found that while many companies disclosed policies and measurable targets around gender matters, they tended to be lacking when it came to transparency about other aspects of diversity."

Owners and investors are targeting offices, digital economy, and logistics properties. Downtown and suburban offices rank first and third overall for global risk-adjusted asset class opportunities. ESG-related actions are still top of mind, but most firms need guidance on how to implement changes and monitor progress."

However, the repercussions of the war in Ukraine on private households  mostly felt through rising energy costs  and the resulting decline in purchasing power are having a negative impact. Against this background, another decrease in rents can be expected for 2023. During the first half of 2022, the office market gained notice- able momentum, with top rents increasing in all surveyed locations. In view of the weakening economic outlook however, this momentum is likely to slow next year, although rents in the German metropolitan areas are still probably going to rise. The residential market is also facing challenges in the top locations, which are already expensive. Private households are suffering from high inflation and higher energy prices, so the scope for rent increases is markedly lower than in the previ- ous years. This study includes an excursus examining the booming niche market of life sciences property, where the megatrends of health and ageing offer growth potential. In this respect, we expect lab offices  which combine laboratory and office spaces under one roof  to become an increasingly important sector for the European transaction market in the next five years.

This creates both abundance and scarcity: abundance of space that no longer meets the increased demands and scarcity of those spaces that do. In many cases, however, even the surplus areas are not fundamentally obsolete. Often it is only a matter of identifying a suitable subsequent use and preparing the land for it.

Monthly retail sales had averaged 2.9 percent annual growth in the 20 years preceding the pandemic. This metric turned negative for the first three months of lockdown. But consumers quickly reallocated dollars that would have gone toward services, travel, and enter- tainment elsewhere . The impact of an unprecedented $6 trillion in stimulus would only further fuel what would become a retail sales holiday. By March 2021, growth was in the double digits, averaging 22.6 percent over the next 14 months. Sales numbers only began to falter in May 2022 as the impact of inflation started to take a bite out of consumer spending. The stimulus also led to a surge in asset prices from homes to equities. 2021s booming stock market led to a round of retail initial public offerings (IPOs), with multiple newly public retail concepts announcing robust growth plans. Business investment surged, as did new business formation. All these factors would spur retailers to their most aggressive growth levels in the better part of a decade. This includes dollar stores and discounters, which have driven retail growth tallies for the better part of the last decade. But the automotive, convenience stores, cosmetics, fitness clubsgyms, grocery, hobby stores, home furnishings, off-price apparel, pet concepts, shoe stores (athletic), and sporting goods categories have all accelerated expansion plans."

Defying just about every prediction voiced during the terrifying and uncertain days of the COVID lockdown that began in March 2020, U. S. commercial property markets actually embarked on a remarkable run, with some of the strongest returns, rent growth, and price appreciation rates ever recorded. Not every property type, however: hotels endured their worst and most sustained downturn in memory, while offices suffered an unprecedented and significant cut in usage of space. And not every market: some of the nations strongest gateway mar- kets, like New York City and San Francisco, experienced sharp outflows of residents, businesses, and tenants of all types. But overall and across much of the United States, property markets far outperformed expectations and historical norms. And now, more than two years on, property investors and managers are learning anew that whopping growth and profits eventually fall back to eartha reversion to the mean, to use finance jargon, or simply normalizing, as numerous industry experts we interviewed put it. Some looming market adjustments will be cyclical due to the weakening economic conditions that most economists and real estate professionals expect, while others represent more of a return to normalcy after all the pandemic-fueled market distortions."

Sources: Deutsche Bank Research, Hypoport Historically, there have been a number of market corrections, especially after long upswings. For example, according to the OECD which uses data from the Federal Statistical Office nominal house prices fell by almost 4 from peak to trough after the boom years of the 1970s. After the reunification boom in the housing market from 1995 to 2007, there was a drop of 8. So the current market correction of 3.6 is not unusual. However, this statement does not apply to real house prices. The very high inflation in 2022 caused house prices to plunge by more than 11 yoy, the sharpest real price decline in the entire time series. House prices also fell much more sharply than real wages, which declined by 3.1 in 2022."

Will Fall 2022 Be a Flash-in-the-Pan Rebound, or a Positive Shift in Long-Term Expectations? While somewhat more difficult to measure, the return to a more normal campus life for students, university employees, and industry professionals alike has been widely welcomed. After all, record leasing activity and record rent growth indirectly point to improved qualitative aspects of student life such as on-campus activities and in-person classes. Only time will tell whether the 2022 rebound is a short-lived bounce back or a resetting of baseline expectations for the coming few years. Though with supply easing and students who elected to take a gap year being reintroduced to the pipeline of prospective student renters, it is reasonable to suggest that the coming few years could see sustained per- formance readings.

How will demographic trends affect the US student housing market? A demographic cliff is looming for college-aged Americans, which stems from a plunge in birthrates during the Great Recession. In four years, marking 18 years since the Global Financial Crisis, colleges and universities will begin to feel the impact of this population decline. The impact, however, will vary across university tiers. Top-tier universities, generally with sub-10 acceptance rates, will fare well, and student housing adjacent to these highly demanded institutions is expected to remain resilient. For mid-to-low tier universities, the current demographic trend is expected to drag enrollment rates. Though universities may seek to increase international student enrollment to offset some of the expected slowdown on the domestic side, immigration is heavily tied to politics and is difficult to predict. Therefore, strategically investing in student housing opportunities near highly sought-after universities should insulate investors from the demographic cliff that is approaching.

Under this scenario, the relative economic strength of Asia Pacific could diminish. Asia Pacific is remarkable in that the policymakers of its two largest economies, China and Japan, are implementing monetary policies that are distinctively different from those of other major central banks . China has implemented monetary easing to support the economic recovery and offset some of the negative impacts of its COVID- Zero policy. Monetary easing, combined with various supportive home purchase policies, could be the catalyst for the housing market in China to bottom. The pace of the housing market recovery will depend on the governments efforts to ensure the delivery of unfinished properties by defaulted developers and the direction of the COVID-Zero policy. Public health restrictions in China are likely to fluctuate under the influence of case resurgences. While the timing of China fully unwinding the policy is uncertain, the end of COVID-Zero, if and when it takes place, would bring a welcome upside to regional and global demand."

To be fair, building owners and developers may also leverage a host of new incentives from federal, state, and local govern- ments, including billions of dollars in the Inflation Reduction Act, to help buildings hit these aggressive climate goals. But these carrots only underscore that the industry faces an increasingly challenging set of environmental regulations. ESG Disclosures So Far A recent survey conducted by RCLCO shows both the progress and potential for greater industry participation. As of June 2022, 38 percent of real estate companies report having policies in place to integrate ESG considerations into the investment pro- cess. But adoption varies widely by type of firm, with generally much higher levels from public companies and institutional investors than private companies . ESG disclosure will be costly, requiring not only capital improve- ments in buildings to reduce carbon impacts but also the systems to measure them and the staff to comply with the proliferation of reporting requirements. Those costs could favor larger, better-capitalized investors, leading to more industry con- solidation."

As reported by Barrons, some have even shifted from strictly granting plus or minus 5 percent of annual spending to mod- els in which they allocate increasingly larger percentages of their assets under management with managers from diverse backgrounds andor with strategies that are focused on bridg- ing wealth and gender gaps. Impact investing can increasingly be informed by data-driven, evidence-based approaches as a result of the growth of big data and social science research, but it will need to be complemented by qualitative input from local, community- based stakeholders who will be essential in co-creating sustainable solutions to reducing inequity. The importance of intentional co-creation cannot be emphasized enough given that only 1 percent of real estate assets under management are deployed by minority-led real estate firms and only 2 per- cent of real estate development companies are led by African Americans. Those investors who may be best positioned to co-create sustainable solutions are still typically unable to access the capital necessary to scale those solutions. It mat- ters where capital is deployed, how it is deployed, and with whom it is deployed. A new generation of impact investors within the real estate industry is innovating holistic approaches to addressing inequity. Their impact frameworks and investment strategies reinforce one another."

A steeper fall is expected to take place in most markets in 2023, with values potentially shedding another 10. This should be seen as a correction rather than a downturn, however, as capital values are still significantly higher than they were two years ago. The keenly priced yields for prime UK and German logistics will most likely soften first, with a relatively larger effect on their capital values in the coming period. Yields in other European markets have not tightened quite as sharply but are also expected to ease in response. Bouwinvest Outlook 2023-2025 10 Europe Retail The retail sector is still recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic and the accelerated penetration of e-commerce. Online retail sales as a percentage of total retail turnover currently averages 12 in Europe and this figure is expected to rise to approximately 21 by 2027. Consumer confidence, meanwhile, is at an all-time low due to sky-high inflation and declining consumer purchasing power. Market rents are therefore expected to remain under pressure for the time being. The gap between contractually agreed rents, which are rising in tandem with consumer price index (CPI) increases, and market rents is widening."

Investors should receive similar ex ante returns for similar risks, or else any free lunches will be arbitraged away. In practice, private market real estate pricing tends to be impacted by broader capital market shifts mainly when there are changes in the cost of real estate debt, since the marginal buyer of income-producing real estate is most often a leveraged buyer. When debt costs rise, the market thins before price pressures are reflected in transactions. This tends to create a time lag between higher interest rates and declines in private equity real estate pricing. In most markets globally, we are now feeling the impact of more expensive real estate debt, which in many cases is no longer accretive to returns at current private market valuations. The math of debt costs and going-in yields is relentless. When the yield starting point is especially low in absolute terms, modest increases in debt costs and yields as measured in basis points mathematically translate into big percentage changes in capital values."

While pure office buildings are still preferred in city centre locations or office centres, lab offices are concentrated on remote and peripheral sites. Because city centre locations play a lesser role, the average rents are slightly below the office market as a whole, but in relation to the respective location, the rents are sometimes significantly higher than comparable office rents. This applies to both laboratory space and the associated office space. With annual rental take-up of a few tens of thousands of square metres  correspon- ding to total office rental in an individual B location  it is not possible to make any definitive statements about the market trend. Rents may also include costs allocated for space expansion and renovation. As a result of the high owner-occupancy rate of properties used for lab offices and the major importance of the public sector, the supply available to investors is ma- nageable. This is reflected in an evaluation by Cushman Wakefield of the five top locations Berlin, Dsseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg and Munich, where a cumulative EUR 3.5bn was invested in lab offices from 2017 to 2021. This corresponds roughly to 2 to 3 per cent of office investment volume. Roughly a third of the investments  around EUR 1.3bn  related to Munich."

In 2021 in Germany more than one fifth of the po- pulation  around 18 million people  had reached the age of 65. However, increa- sed life expectancy has not so far been accompanied by improved fitness levels. In fact the opposite is true. A sedentary lifestyle, high-calorie food, ready meals contai- ning a lot of sugar, and the consumption of alcohol and tobacco have consequences, and considerably increase the risk of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, demen- tia, heart attacks, cancer and strokes. The growing number of older people suffering ill health is also a significant economic factor. In 2020 for example, German spending on healthcare reached a new record of EUR 440bn  13 per cent of economic output. Lifestyle and ageing will be major contributory factors to the continuing growth in healthcare spending in Germany and in many other countries.

After a higher level of brand-new space coming onto the market in 2020 and 2021 than in previous years, less new space is ex- pected this year and next year, which should slow down the rise in prime rents.

Too low a quality of stay could lead to a downward spi- ral. If customers stay away, retailers and bars and restaurants will withdraw, causing the offer to deteriorate further. Retail: comparison of top locations The retail headwind has also had an impact on flagship stores accustomed to suc- cess, particularly since the time was undoubtedly right for a painful adjustment here. On the one hand, previous years saw the emergence of a large volume of new retail space, for example in the form of city centre shopping centres. On the other hand, prime rents are not only highest here, they are also much stronger than in other large German cities. However, no major crisis has materialised, and below the line seven top locations have even performed comparatively well. Prime rents have fallen on average by a fairly moderate 10 per cent or so from their 2017 peak, although since 2010 they had previously increased by more than a quar- ter. Conversely, prime rents in other large cities declined more sharply, but without the previous strong increase.

Portfolio aggregation strategies with smaller asset sizes that lend themselves to averaging-in with diversified timing of entry points represent another way to cope with volatile and uncertain values.  The inputs to the math are not changing to the same degree in every part of the world. Wherever rate spikes are less intense, or the prospects for rental growth are clearest, transaction activity and prices have been less impacted.  In addition to debt costs, investors should also consider the trajectory of cash flows, which depend on economic fundamentals and real estate occupier market conditions. The differential prospects for real estate cash flows are the subject of the next section. G LO BA L 2 The path of fundamentals will ultimately help determine where values settle Early in 2022, we framed the impact of rising inflation and interest rates on values as a race between debt costs and net operating income growth, as we anticipated that higher inflation would translate into higher rents in some sectors. Currently, it seems that debt costs are mostly winning the race. Ultimately, however, valuations are the result of the interaction between higher debt costs and the path of real estate fundamentals, the prospects for which vary widely across sectors and geographies. Tracing back real estate cash flows to their drivers is to follow a chain of causation back to basic variables like population, GDP, industrial production, consumer spending and employment."

Instead of 400,000 completed flats per year, as targeted by the federal government, a figure 200,000 new flats in 2023 seems much more likely. In 2024, it is likely to be even lower. The supply-demand relationship is thus out of balance as rarely before . In the next few years, we therefore expect the already very low vacancy rates in most rental housing markets to fall further and rents to rise. From the landlords point of view, the fundamental framework conditions not only remain favourable, the outlook has even improved compared to last year. However, the socially explosive nature of these developments is likely to call government onto the scene. Recently, it was decided to increase the linear depreciation from 2 to 3. For new rental housing that meets the EH-40 standard and the requirements of the Quality Seal for Sustainable Buildings (QNG), it will even be possible to write off 5 of the construction costs over four years. Although these and possibly upcoming decisions will not have an effect on the number of completions in the short term, in the medium term they could significantly boost construction activity in rental housing. We think it is conceivable that 400,000 flats per year will actually be completed in the next legislative period."

Prices Softening Coming at a time when rising interest rates and mortgage coupons have put a dent in transactions and pricing in all property types, investor concerns about the future of office count as a double whammy. Property values dropped 10 to 20 percent as of midyear 2022 and capitalization rates are likely to keep rising as interest rates, the cost of debt, and risk premiums all move higher. Office values will fall more than other property sectors such as multifamily in which rising rents counterbalance higher cap rates.

Moreover, there are few active core buyers, as most have substantial office allocations and have a dim view of the risk-return outlook for the office sector. These factors should lead to equity losses for many office owners and the expected emergence of distressed transactions. We expect office demand to recover slowly, as obsolete buildings are removed due to conversion of use or demolition. Fundamentals and rents will eventually recover, but that is likely years away. Healthy fundamentals sustain many sectors through economic weakness The sector chasm referenced in the global chapter has produced a variety of winners in the North American market. These include industrial and apartments and in the US, single-family rental and self-storage. These sectors are still experiencing the same interest rate math that is driving up borrowing rates, raising required returns and resulting in lower transaction prices. However, despite the negative near-term economic outlook, we still expect these sectors to generate positive rent growth in 2023 and beyond. To be clear, our view is that rent growth will be closer to long-term averages than during the inflation-fueled spike of 2021 and 2022. But vacancy rates in these sectors are still well below long-term averages, giving a cushion before pricing power shifts towards tenants . Weaker demand and still-elevated new supply will shift vacancy rates up in 2023 and lead to a slowdown, but not stagnation, in rent growth."

Secular megatrends and structural features like legal and contractual constraints also matter. Going into 2023, there is increased uncertainty in many of these variables, especially the economic ones, given the pace of economic expansion is expected to be weaker or negative. This will have a cooling impact on property NOI growth, but nuances remain given that the transmission of macroeconomic conditions to real estate is a winding path. Starting with the underlying economic fundamentals, we are seeing a great deal of variation globally. In addition to the dimensions of depth and duration, a key uncertainty surrounding the coming downturn is how widespread it will be. Europe faces especially severe challenges stemming from an energy price shock, with ripple effects of unknown global scope. The dominant driver of inflation in the US, Canada and Singapore is that their economies are robust and operating close to full capacity. Demand- led inflation is relatively benign compared to inflation from a supply shock, but the central banks in these countries must still raise interest rates, either to manage their domestic economic situations or because their monetary policies are linked to the US Federal Reserve .

Moving beyond sector selection In the US, sector selection is likely to remain important to investors due to the uniquely dim outlook for its office market. But investors can still develop an edge by identifying the best markets and strategies within sectors. There are a wide range of metro areas in North America for an investor to sort through to identify the best targets and there is no shortcut around doing the work to identify the best-positioned markets. The rent growth outlook, in combination with pricing and market risk factors, remain paramount in this selection process. An additional lens we are putting into that market selection process is exposure to climate change risks. Hurricane Ian was a reminder of the exposure that many Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Seaboard metros have to tropical cyclones, and these storms are getting stronger and more frequent with rising ocean temperatures."

While volumes reached around 20 billion in the first quarter of 2022, estimates for the fourth quarter are only around 6 billion. Ulrich Hller on the expectations for 2023: We can see a number of signals that might indicate a waning in the momentum of inflation, interest rates, energy as well as material and construction costs. However, we do not expect a sustainable trend reversal before 2024, by which time the economy should also be picking up speed again. Ulrich Hller on the development of rental prices: Existing rents will increase for two main reasons: rents for commercial real estate are usually index-linked. Taking into account the high inflation rates, this means that rents will increase accordingly. At the same time, the reduced number of development projects will increase the demand for existing properties, therefore putting further upwards pressure on rents. In particular, rents for objects in sought-after locations as well as for high-quality and energy-efficient properties will increase significantly because supply will not be able to meet demand in the foreseeable future. The so-called global war for talent, in which the working environment has become a key competitive factor, further adds to this. If you are to perform well, you want to work in an attractive environment  in addition to a comfortable infrastructure, this also includes options for communication with space for individual personal meetings."

Up to the second quarter of 2022, pent-up demand and the contemporary space needed for new office concepts drove up office rents by a good 7 per cent compared to the same quarter last year. The now gloomier economic outlook and the risk of recession are likely to slow the pace of rents despite the supply shortage.  The downward trend in Retail rents has come to an end. However, the pros- pects are fairly gloomy as household spending is hit by high inflation, and parti- cularly by the hike in energy costs. In addition, the numbers of passers-by and tourists have risen again to gratifyingly high levels.  Residential rents increased recently by around 3.5 per cent, continuing their longstanding trend of lagging behind consumer prices. Stagnating demographic growth and an increased supply of newly built properties are slowing the pace of rent growth. Prospects are caught between households which are bearing a heavy burden of high inflation and multiplied heating costs, and a contraction in the housing supply as new construction slows."

We also see an acute shortage of high-quality office space that is aligned with net zero carbon goals in many markets. We are least optimistic about the office sector in the US and low-quality malls almost anywhere. Obstacles to rental growth, many of which were not evident at previously low levels of inflation, must be considered. For example, despite a favorable supplydemand balance in many European residential markets, regulations prevent rents from keeping pace. Likewise, inflation-linked leases are hitting nominal indexation caps that nobody ever expected to reach.

Only the prime highstreet locations in the metropolises could escape this development. However, such locations have shrunk considerably and the rent differential to adjacent locations is becoming steeper. Even beyond the coming year, the non- neighbourhood-oriented retail sector will continue to be characterised by consolidation. This is helped by the fact that some of the increased costs, especially for staff, are of a structural nature. As a result, the demand for space is likely to continue to shrink. Exceptions prove the rule, and there are many of them. They include the already crisis-proof luxury segment, but also many sneaker and young fashion brands as well as the still expanding e-car manufacturers. In the sought-after locations, new occupiers will continue to be found for spaces that are falling vacant. In some cases, the rent on a new lease can even be significantly higher than before. A prerequisite, however, is often a modernisation of the space, because retailers demands on the space are increasing. Food retailing and other local suppliers remain an anchor of stability, especially as they benefit disproportionately from the high immigration. There are even opportunities for expansion here, because the increase in working from home has led to a migration of purchasing power from office locations to residential areas. In any case, mobile working, changed mobility behaviour and also demographic change argue for a more decentralised retail structure."

We have grown too quickly and havent decided what we want to be when we grow up. Like some other Sun Belt markets, this former 18-Hour City has graduated to a full-fledged 24-hour metropolis, but the regional infrastructure has strained to keep pace. Too Much, Too Soon The pandemic supercharged interregional migration patterns to leading Sun Belt and lifestyle metro areas, as well as intrare- gional migrations from CBDs to suburbs. Some of this migration was destined to reverse eventually. Some households left their inner-city apartments for safer environs until the pandemic was better understood and brought under control. Some young adults moved back in with their parents until their jobs reopened or their old neighborhood revived. Many of these migrants have moved back to their old places. But beyond these temporary moves, the pandemic acceler- ated more permanent migration. Some workers were freed to move wherever they wanted by flexible work arrangements that became more commonplace during the pandemic. Many left expensive coastal markets in search of more affordable lifestyle markets that offer what they perceive to be more favor- able amenities or superior economic opportunities. A ULI focus group participant from Salt Lake City said, Quality of life and affordability have been great draws to the market. Sustained high growth will test these factors long-term.

In addition, emissions are to be calculated over the life cycle for new buildings. For renovations, photovoltaic systems are to be mandatory from 2032. Oil and gas heating systems are to be replaced in major renovations. The recently presented national bill to amend the Building Energy Act pursues similar goals. From 2024, heating systems in new buildings and renovations are to be based on 65 renewable energies. In addition, the German government plans to make it mandatory to replace heating systems that are 30 years old. The 2014 Energy Saving Ordinance already contained a similar provision, and since 2015 there has been an obligation to replace constant-temperature boilers. The modern boilers significantly reduced consumption, which often made the investment worthwhile. With the replacement now required in favor of a heat pump or a district heating, rapid amortization is likely to be difficult. An exchange obligation without generous national support might meet substantial resistances. Often, however, little attention is paid to the numerous exceptions in both the European and the national draft legislation. The European text allows exceptions for listed buildings, and national governments can also make exceptions to the obligation to install photovoltaic systems. In addition, there are several formulations such as if this is technically and economically feasible. The national draft law contains the word if possible. So there should be exceptions."

The sunbelt states in the south are expected to outperform the north-east and mid-west rust-belt states due to migration patterns, a tax-friendly environment, and the greater affordability of housing. Several challenges warrant close monitoring, however. Persistently high U. S. inflation is diminishing the affordability of index-linked rental accommodation. Rent controls are uncommon, except in some coastal states, but the public debate on regulating more rental housing is heating up. Construction costs are climbing on the back of wage and raw materials price hikes, creating additional risks for early-stage housing schemes. At the same time a decline in the volume of new developments could shore up the valuations of existing stock. As in Europe, the long-term average spread between residential real estate and risk-free government bond yields is above current spread levels .

But for all that, most commercial real estate professionals we interviewed for this years Emerging Trends remain reasonably upbeat about longer-term prospects. Not everyone is as sanguine as the CEO of an investment management firm who provided our opening quote, and there certainly are some troubling risks ahead for the industry. But the consensus mood seems to be one of cautious optimism that we will ride out any near-term slump and be well positioned for another period of sustained growth and strong returns. It makes sense that real estate experts would take the long view given the nature of real estate assets: buildings take a long time to conceive and develop. Even simply acquiring one typically takes more time than buying just about any other type of financial asset, and they are usually held for longer dura- tions. Still, the willingness of so many people in the industry to look beyond some of the cyclical headwinds is striking."

In addition, the German Heat Pump Association considers the targets to be feasible, which is particularly positive in view of its overly cautious sales forecasts in the past. In view of the numerous pro and con arguments and the scant data available, it remains unclear from an analytical perspective whether the 6 million target will be achieved in 2030. Not only supply bottlenecks but also insufficient demand could stand in the way of achieving the target. The introduction and enforcement of regulatory laws are politically explosive. Moreover, a simple subsidy is unlikely to close a potential demand gap. Prices for air-to-water heat pumps have roughly doubled in the last 15 years. The state subsidy therefore probably flowed primarily to the manufacturers of heat pumps and not to the property owners. In addition to the replacement of heating systems, the focus is on the building envelope. Although the Building Energy Act provides regulations for the thermal transmittance coefficient, which measures a building's heat output to the outside, these typically reflect the current technology standards of the building components. Thus, the legal requirements are much less challenging than the heat pump target. 5.3 Price differences between low and high emission buildings Low-emission buildings arguably already command price premiums.

Cologne is also bottom of the league along with Stuttgart for prime rents with a figure of EUR 26 per m2 respectively. In the case of Cologne, this is likely also to relate to the fact that the public sector accounts for a large part of the demand for office space. However, after a long period of stagnation, prime rents in Cologne put in a stronger rise from 2018 onwards. As in the other office markets, this reflected a very meagre supply. In spite of growing white-collar employment, the volume of new space remained moderate. The Covid-led decline in letting activity was mostly concentrated in 2020. There was already a strong rise in take-up last year to a high level of slightly over 300,000 m2.

In this context, they will also focus their considerations on the German market. This development can already be observed today. 2. Current trends and developments Ulrich Hller on the shortage of skilled workers: The shortage of skilled workers has turned into a serious business risk in the construction industry as well. At the beginning of 2022, in a survey by the Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry , 78 per cent of construction companies identified the shortage of skilled workers as the main risk to their own economic development. In 2010, by contrast, it was only 21 per cent. Labour costs have always been very important in the personnel-intensive construction industry. Here, only changes in the legal framework can produce relief: Germany urgently needs an efficient and targeted immigration law that provides the economy with significantly more qualified and motivated workers who want to learn and prove themselves. Ulrich Hller on the ESG topic: The number one subject of discussion in 2021 was the implementation of ESG requirements. Even though it was pushed into the background in 2022, this will return to be the prevailing topic in the future. The issue of climate protection, decarbonisation and the required reduction of the CO2 footprint presents us with dramatically growing challenges around the globe."

In-person office attendance remains substantially below that of other regions, with limited prospects for near-term improvement. N O R T H A M E R I CA The US and Canadian economies and real estate markets are dealing with the global challenges of high inflation, higher interest rates and dimming economic growth outlooks in similar ways. Both also enter 2023 with economies that are still growing and real estate fundamentals largely in balance. There are challenges, but the medium- to long-term outlook remains brighter than the outlook for the near-term. Real estate investors need strategies that are resilient to an expected volatile environment in 2023 and take advantage of the opportunities emerging from volatility. Stubbornly high inflation The root cause of market challenges heading into 2023 is elevated inflation. The US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada have both made lowering inflation their top priority, but it remains stubbornly high in both markets. This led to policy rates increasing from effectively zero to over four percent by year end. The increase in policy rates has been mirrored in long-term rates and in real estate borrowing rates. The impact has been a dramatic shift in the direction of property values, from a rapid rise in 2021 and early 2022, to a fall in the second half of 2022."

The Future of Single-Family Housing The early 2020s have been a transformative time for the housing industry as the pandemic caused people around the world to reevaluate both where they live and how they live. The United States experienced the Great American Move in which house- holds and businesses relocated to more affordable places, often to buy or rent a home with additional space and a yard, and farther from employment centers. Builders across the country could not keep up with the new demandand supply chain interruptions, labor shortages, and permitting delays during the COVID-19 pandemic did not help matters. As a result, home prices escalated at historic rates. The median new home price in the United States increased 22 percent since the start of 2020 and existing home prices increased 58 percent. 45 Today, the single-family housing industry is on the other side of the rapid run-up in demand and pricesinflation and the rapid escalation of mortgage rates have resulted in a cooldown of the for-sale housing market."

Streaming digital content, conducting electronic transactions, sending emails, using a smart thermostat, or scrolling through social media all involve the use of a data center. Given the immense cost of downtime, data centers are highly technical and employ infrastructure to keep things running.

As elsewhere, retail activity in Dsseldorf has also suffered as a result of the Covid restrictions, however the impact on the rental business has been less severe than in other top locations. Prime rents have remained largely unchan- ged, declining only marginally. The retail location is supported by a catchment area of 2 million people and high spending power, which is nearly 20 per cent higher than the German average. Dsseldorf city centre is well known far beyond the borders of the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia for its famous K shopping boulevard, which is synonymous with fashion and luxury. Other prime locations in the city centre in addition to the Knigsallee are Flingerstrae and the Schadowstrae shopping street. Further additions in recent years have been iconic retail developments such as K-Bogen, the KII and the renovated K-Galerie shopping mall. Another highlight planned for 2023 will be the opening of a branch of the Berlin-based KaDeWe in the Carsch-Haus. A whole series of planning applications for the years ahead relates to the area around the K, for example new buildings to replace the former Kaufhof to- gether with a multi-storey car park, and the former Commerzbank building."

The head of an insti- tutional investment advisory firm says they are paying much closer attention to supply in traditionally unconstrained markets, especially Dallas, Atlanta, Austin, and Phoenix. We are prob- ably relatively less attracted to the growth markets despite their fundamentals, relative to where we were last year. These were the hot markets, but were a little concerned about what it looks like going forward. But dont count out these markets just yet. In-migration to these markets will continue, if at a slower pace going forward, and will continue to attract a disproportionate share of the investment capital. And any oversupply of homes could help ease hous- ing affordability concerns. Concludes the head of research for an investment management firm, Weve always been about growth markets because weve always believed that population and employment growth are keys to success. And they can also cover up a lot of mistakes. So those markets are still a major focus. 8. Smarter, Fairer Cities through Infrastructure Spending  Infrastructure spending is back among the top trends in Emerging Trends, but this time on a more hopeful note.

The growth of e-commerce is expected to slow, however, due to the fading pandemic and an expected economic recession. We expect the volume of new leasing transactions to be more sluggish than in the exceptionally strong years of 2020 and 2021. E-commerce giant Amazon, the largest corporate user of logistics space in the U. S. has indicated that it will sublease a significant part (10) of its warehouse space. New logistics supply may exceed demand in the coming years but increasing regulatory pressure from governments in markets such as the Inland Empire in southern California and New Jersey is curtailing the supply of new greenfield developments. Prime capital values are estimated to drop around 5 below Q4 2021 levels at end-2022, with the exception of Los Angeles and the adjacent Inland Empire, where growth is expected to persist until the year-end. Average capital growth during the outlook period is forecast to be slightly negative due to softening yields. The sharpest drop is foreseen in 2023 ahead of a stabilization in subsequent years.

Many of the changes were relatively minor, and nine of the 10 highest-rated markets last year repeated this year . But there were some material changes over the year as about a quarter of markets moved up or down in rankings by at least 10 places. And consistent with our normal- izing trend, many of the markets near the top of the standings last year have fallen this year, while many previously lower- rate markets have risen: More than half (11) of the 20-highest rated markets in last years survey fell in the rankings this year, although almost all by less than 10 places. Meanwhile, some of the markets that were found lower in the rankings in prior years are now finding more support. Thirteen of the 20-lowest rated markets in last years survey rose in the rankings this year. Some Like It Hot Despite the modest drop in the Supernova ratings this year, Emerging Trends survey respondents still see the best prospects in Sun Belt metropolitan areas, which have been growing over time.

index_300t_chunks:Deloitte 2023 Commercial Real Estate Outlook.pdf-!5,5,Deloitte 2023 Commercial Real Estate Outlook.pdf,"2 The most likely scenario is that economic growth continues through 2022, though tightening monetary policy, peaking employment growth, and continued energy and food shortages slow this near-term growth trajectory. Inflation would remain high through 2022, but gradually settle around 2 by mid-2023 as demand for goods subsides in favor of services, helping businesses alleviate supply chain issues. The Federal Reserve would raise rates to combat inflation through 2022, but slow rate increases as inflation normalizes. Other, less likely scenarios include: (1) Back to the 1970s (25) where businesses raise prices and wages in lockstep and there is sustained high inflation. (2) COVID-19 relapse (5) in which vaccines become ineffective, and lockdowns are again imposed. And (3) Next recession (15), triggered by overly aggressive tightening of monetary policy as governments attempt to tame inflation. Regardless of which scenario comes to fruition, the 2023 Deloitte real estate outlook survey reveals that concerns about the economy are top of mind for most global real estate leaders as they prepare for the remainder of 2022 and 2023 .

S. health care system supports an insured population of more than 300 million people and represents over 18 per- cent of U. S. gross domestic product. The medical real estate that supports this industry generally falls into two categories: inpatient, or hospitals, and outpatient, or medical office buildings (MOBs). Occupied by medical tenants, MOBs are facilities where services and procedures are performed on an outpatient basis. These buildings may be on a hospital campus or attached to the hospital building. They may also be located out in the community in more convenient areas for patients to drive to. They might be occupied by practi- tioners of various types of specialties, ranging from urgent care to dialysis centers to ambulatory surgery centers and, of course, regular physician offices. They are generally purpose built for medical use and have features that attract medical tenants like a covered drop-off or a backup genera- tor for emergency power. Due to the increasing number of insured people who followed the introduction of the Affordable Care Act of 2010, as well as an aging population, the already significant demand for medi- cal services has continued to grow. In addition, advances in medical technologies have enabled the transfer of many inpatient procedures to lower-cost, more-efficient outpatient settings."

The Emerging Trends survey confirmed that industry partici- pants are conflicted about pricing, favoring niche sectors such as medical office, and expecting that suburban offices will retain value better than center city offices. Conversions to Rise, but . . As tenants eschew older, lower-quality stock, that means that more office buildings are candidates for conversion. Obsolete 62 office buildings around the country are being converted to multifamily, industrial, medical offices, life sciences, and other uses. States such as New York and New Jersey are exploring legislation to ease the entitlement process around conversions. It makes perfect sense in Manhattan, where the office vacancy rate has shot up in Midtown as tenants chase new buildings in Hudson Yards and housing is in critically short supply. For example, New York developers Silverstein Properties and Macklowe Properties are converting office towers to apartments, and Hines is converting a tower in Salt Lake City. Even so, conversions remain sporadic relative to the new constructionnearly 150 million square feet of office space is under construction nationally, per Yardi Matrixdue to logistics. Conversions are costly and the stars need to be aligned with the right building configuration, floor plates, neighborhood ameni- ties, and demand, not to mention considerations such as tax structure.

In combination with monetary tightening, there would then be less money available for real estate investments than before until the long-term growth trend gains the upper hand again. From a German perspective, there is another question: how safe is Germany still perceived as an investment haven? For the moment, we believe we can observe that overseas investors at least have become more cautious. The economic weakness plays a role here, as does the war in Ukraine. On the other hand, the euro has depreciated and the interest rate differential of the euro area against most other currencies has increased significantly.

Well look back in 10 years, and the prices that seem astronomical today will seem like a bargain 10 years from now. An Economic Rorschach Test By one popular rule of thumb, the U.

But in most of Europe, regulations limit the ability of landlords to capture this growth into net operating income. Regulatory systems in continental nations like Germany and Denmark have tended to allow low and steady single-digit percent income growth rates and still do so, but this looks unattractive in an environment of nearly double-digit inflation. Moreover, rent controls are getting tighter, as governments look for ways to relieve pressure on households. In 2023, the handful of unregulated markets, such as the UK, are set to fare much better. The more niche living sectors, such as student housing, senior housing and co-living, typically benefit from longstanding demographic trends, supporting occupier demand. They also tend to offer a yield premium to traditional residential and do not generally face limitations on rent increases. As such, they represent an attractive alternative to traditional residential, even in markets where mainstream apartments are heavily regulated. When it comes to geographical selections, LaSalle is guided in part by our proprietary tools for location targeting, such as the European Cities Growth Index and the LaSalle European Human Capital Index , which quantify secular themes and highlight regions best placed to benefit from them .

German rents tend to be low in an international comparison, ancillary costs high In the global ranking of the 90 cities with the highest rents, only Munich is found, in 75th place, where one has to pay almost EUR 2,000 per month for a 3-room apartment outside the city centre. This is roughly equivalent to new contract rents in other databases. More expensive cities are mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries, where rents are often low or unregulated. However, there are also a few exceptions in continental Europe, for example a number of Swiss cities such as Geneva, Zug, Zurich, Lausanne, Basel, but also Luxembourg with rents of up to EUR 3,000, and also Amsterdam, Copenhagen, and Paris with around EUR 2,000 per month. In German cities such as Berlin, Frankfurt, Freiburg, Hamburg, Dsseldorf, Heidelberg, and Darmstadt, around EUR 1,400 per month must be paid and in Stuttgart, Karlsruhe, Cologne, and Mannheim around EUR 1,200 per month.

We expect this latter trend to continue in the coming years, with Germany and France currently showing the most resistance to new greenfield developments. As a result, nominal rental growth, although slowing down, is expected to remain positive during the outlook period at a figure just shy of 3.0 per annum. Global supply chain disruption following the pandemic and ongoing geopolitical tensions are also fuelling a supply chain reconfiguration with a greater emphasis on onshoring over just-in-time.

Whereas the prime rent was in the mid-field among the top loca- tions up to 2016, the upturn led to a rapid rise to EUR 42 per m2 most recently. In contrast, the vacancy rate had fallen to just over 1 per cent by the beginning of 2020, although it has since risen again to 3.5 per cent at the half-way stage in 2022. This marked increase reflects weaker demand for office space during the pandemic along with a huge surge in new building activity. However, years of little activity in the con- struction segment led to an inexorable widening in the gap between demand for modern office space and supply, so that even a high level of new space could not slow down the rise in prime rents. High demand for office space in the first half of 2022 led to take-up of 390,000 m2. The only time this figure was beaten was in the first half of 2017 and 2020 respectively. From the second half of 2022, however, the combination of energy crisis and recession fears is likely to dampen the strength of the Berlin office market and lead to a flattening in the rise in rents."

Another contributory factor is that low cold rents often apply in the case of older dwellings where poor insulation and less efficient heating often leads to higher fuel consumption. In contrast, high energy prices are having a more moderate impact in the case of new, well insulated homes with more efficient heating systems. Landlords now face the unfortunate task of passing on higher bills to their tenants. Since advance payments were made based on existing heating costs, households can expect to receive as yet unquantified demands to make up the dif- ference. These could be too much, especially for lower-income tenants without any cash reserves. It is likely that landlords will have to adapt to a much higher level of arrears than in the past. Some housing companies have already lowered the tem- perature of heating systems, at least reducing the risk of a shock from additional charges."

Residential rents continued to rise in 2022 as well Residential rents in top locations continued to rise in 2022. On average, they rose by around 2.5 per cent yoy across the seven cities. This means a more moderate rate than the average annual rent rise of over 4 per cent in the last ten years. This slower rent rise is likely to be related to already high rents and moreover to the fact that the population growth has come to a halt. Moreover, the level of initial rents is also being dampened by an improvement in supply through a rise in the number of completions. Unlike in previous years from 2010 onwards, rents have risen slower than inflation since the end of 2021. At the half-way point in 2022, the average initial rent in top locations ranged from EUR 13.80 per m2 in Dsseldorf to EUR 20.80 per m2 in Munich. The average initial rent across the seven cities was around EUR 16.50 per m2. It rose by over 50 per cent over ten years. By comparison, the average rent for re-lets is EUR 13.70 per m2.

Retrofitting for the Future The obstacles to converting from one property type to another are varied and daunting. Many owners will rise to the challenge, but such undertakings are often not practicaleither too expen- sive or just too difficult. But the need to retrofit for the future, as one real estate adviser points out, provides another set of opportunities that may be more limited in scope but ultimately broader in scale. Owners and managers of real estate will need to enhance the resilience of their assets against potential climate change impacts or otherwise decarbonize their assets as increasingly demanded by tenants, investors, and regulators, as we discuss in greater detail below. But whether a full-scale conversion to another land use or a more limited retrofit to higher building standards, there is a compelling sustainability reason for these projects beyond their potential financial feasibility.

With pandemic-related regulations and restrictions largely being phased out, urban markets are getting closer to fully reopened and experiencing recent surges in lodging demand, giving pric- ing power to the operators. So far, the resurgence in demand in these markets is attributed, in descending order, to leisure, group, and business travel. Inbound international travel has contributed to the recovery in several of the top 25 markets and is expected to play an even larger part in the recovery through the remainder of 2022 and into 2023. The U. S. Travel Association predicts that international arrivals will total 47.9 million by the end of 2022 and 65 million by the end of 2023, representing 60 and 82 percent of 2019 inbound international traffic levels, respectively. The increase in international arrivals in 2022 represents a 117 percent increase over 2021.

This growth will be slower than in our other market groups but represents the biggest increase from the recent past to the expected near term. This reversal perhaps accounts for the modest relative improve- ment in the 2023 ratings of the markets in this group. Accordingly, the Magnets have maintained their dominance at the top of the Emerging Trends ratings. Although their average ranking slipped slightly this year, more markets moved up than down. Growth is expected to be greatest in the Supernova subgroup but moderating from its recent torrid pace. For example, popula- tion growth is projected to slow from 1.9 percent annually over the Affordability Matters, Too Quality of life and affordability also matter. Many of the markets that received relatively lower scores this year have inadequate infrastructure for their population size and growth, here measured by their transit availability score. The failure to adequately expand the regional infrastructure was a problem identified by local experts we interviewed and an impediment to future growth. 75 Housing affordability is another constraint on growth.

Some of those buildings will come back to the lenders, but others may be can- didates for conversion to other uses. One affordable housing developer is optimistic about the poten- tial for more housing. Anybody whos sitting in city hall with a homelessness problem, which is pretty much everybody, needs to start thinking about how to take some of these office buildings and repurpose them into all flavors of residential, including some homeless shelters. But as with the aforementioned mall conversions, that would require a tremendous value decline to make such projects feasible, among other hurdles. That capitulation could be painful and really has yet to begin. Half of the industry people surveyed for Emerging Trends believe that central-city offices are over- priced. But at some point, owners may have no alternative to a serious writedown if office tenant demand keeps falling. Moving from Here to There Discussions with experienced practitioners for the upcoming ULI report, Behind the Facade: The Feasibility of Converting Commercial Real Estate to Multifamily, suggest several lessons that can increase the odds of successful conversions. First is the understanding that there is no cookie-cutter building to convert, particularly when converting commercial real estate to multifam- ily use. Not only is each experience different, but developers of successful conversions expect that each subsequent one will be different."

New building activity did not start to pick up until 2012 onwards, long after the surge in immigration after the turn of the century. On an aggregated basis across top locations, only around 20,000 homes p. a. were built from 2002 to 2011. Thereafter, completion figures rose to over 50,000 units up until 2018. Rising purchase prices, rental growth and higher investor demand made new builds lucrative. Between 2016 and 2019, building permits for 60,000 flats and more were issued every year, which means that even higher numbers of units could have been built. Instead, however, housing construction has been slowing down again since 2019  falling to around 40,000 units by 2021. Building in towns and cities was hampered by the fact that the construction industry was working more or less at capacity, by a shortage of skilled workers and of materials, along with the emergence of protests here and there.

But more relaxed taxation and regulation come at a cost, as evidenced by the challenges of accommodating massive population inflows. Of course, every fast-growing city that successfully morphs into a major metropolis inevitably experiences growing pains along the way. A key issue confronting the current generation of hyper- growth markets is whether they will invest in the infrastructure and regional planning needed to facilitate growth while maintain- ing the qualities that led to their appeal. 21 One ULI focus group participant in Austin said, The disadvan- tages of housing affordability, lack of mobility due to inadequate infrastructure, and property taxes will likely negatively impact our market in the coming years.

Indeed, in the largest single metaverse entity, more than US$350 million in virtual property transactions were made in 2021 alone.81 Our survey respondents are dipping their toes into these digital waters: While 21 expressed no interest in anything metaverse- related, at 35, the share of those that are researching further capabilities exceeds any other identified emerging technology. While the notion of virtual real estate is interesting from a financial point of view, perhaps the more compelling use case for the metaverse in the near term is as an augmented form of ARVR for design and to gather community feedback. Speaking of design, with the expansion of virtual work, the potential for metaverse-based conference rooms could have longer-term impacts on the design of office and other properties.82 RECOMMENDATIONS  Consider the benefits that external service providers and proptechs can provide to existing operations. Leveraging a third party to cover back-office functions could allow CRE firms to spend more time enhancing core services. Innovative technology partners can also differentiate frontline offerings from competitors.  Technology is not a place where the real estate industry should be cutting back on spending."

A fall in the number of Chinese tourists has also affected retail turnover figures in APAC, especially Hong Kong. Even if the number of tourists from mainland China do pick up, softening economic growth and pressure on Chinas real estate market could lead to a decrease in spending. Bouwinvest Outlook 2023-2025 27 Asia Pacific Niches Niche real estate sectors are not yet as developed in Asia Pacific as they are in the U. S. or Europe, but there are pockets of investment opportunities, nevertheless. Relatively strict Covid-19 measures in the APAC region meant that students were unable to travel abroad during 2020 and 2021, but now that most borders have fully reopened the mid- to longer-term outlook for purpose-built student accommodation looks significantly more promising. For example, longer-term fundamentals for Australia remain strong: its universities are highly rated in global rankings, (domestic) enrolments are rising and supply shortfalls still exist. Further institutionalization and consolidation are expected in this niche segment of the market. Asias institutional data centre market is relatively immature and is still developing. Key structural demand drivers include e-commerce growth, working from home, online gaming, video streaming, data storage, cloud computing, internet of things and IT outsourcing."

Tourism is also picking up again. Although the number of overnight stays has not yet returned to 2019 levels, it is clearly gaining momentum. However, retailers are likely to be feeling the pain in the absence of high-spending Chinese customers.

Simply constructing more housing may be the most obvious and effective solution, but is far from easy to achieve. Housing is too expensive. It has been that way for too longfor too many people neither for-sale nor rental housing is afford- ablebut prices and rents have soared even further out of reach over the course of the past year. And even if we experi- ence an economic downturn, as many economists expect, it is not projected to provide significant relief. It starts with record home prices. The U. S. median existing- home price jumped by over 18 percent in 2021 alonethe largest increase on record going back to the early 1950s and then tacked on a further 15 percent through mid-2022. Combined with rapidly rising mortgage rates, housing afford- ability has fallen to its lowest level in over 30 years relative to incomes, according to the National Association of Realtors."
index_300t_chunks:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!77,21,isa-outlook-2023.pdf," Despite the extensive market uncertainty, many European occupier markets continue to show surprisingly robust activity, at least so far. The key to this has been a combination of occupiers playing catch-up post-pandemic, long- standing shortages of certain kinds of stock, tightening limitations on land use and supply discipline driven by developers and their lenders. Office take-up in the first three quarters of 2022 has been 6.7 above the five-year average, according to JLL. European office vacancy rates have remained below the long-term average of 7.5, with many markets posting vacancy rates still comfortably below their natural rates of vacancy , as shown in Exhibit EU.4. Sentiment can turn quickly, however. Office users continue to contend with uncertainty around how much and what sort of space they will require in the long term. As we suggest in the global section of this report, a stable balance of in-person and virtual interaction may have been reached, but long leases and wait-and-see attitudes mean we do not yet have clarity on sustainable levels of office demand. One aspect of occupier demand that is clear is that many European office tenants want to occupy buildings that are on a pathway to net zero carbon, which remain few and far between. The owners and developers of the best quality, low-carbon office assets can achieve rents higher than even so-called prime rents."

City centre sales space increased accordingly by more than 20 per cent in 2014. In response to the now lower demand for sales space, Gerber will be converted to a mixed use quarter by 2023. Further building plans in the city centre relate to the new construction of office and retail space to replace the former sports arena (Knig-Schulstrae) and the new Bundesbank building on the former Kaufhof site (Eberhardstrae).

Note: Based on U. S. respondents only. More a Lull Than a Crash If transaction volumes do fall, few real estate people expect a crash or liquidity crunch in property markets. Notably, there are few signs of distress. Balance sheets are generally strong, lever- age is low, and values have not fallen very far, so few assets are underwater with their debt. Moreover, replacement financing is generally still available for those who need it, if at a higher price and with tighter underwriting. Many investors and developers are willing to look beyond the short-term turbulence to focus on longer-term opportunities, a theme we introduced in our open- ing overview. Thus, there are few examples of motivated sellers in the market."

Fundamental supply shortages in the eleven metropolitan areas: Our projects suggest an end to the bottlenecks in Bremen and Nuremberg. Interest rate sensitivity is also likely to be relatively high there. In Dsseldorf and Hamburg, the bottlenecks will end in the next few years. In Berlin, Frankfurt, Hanover, Heidelberg, Cologne, Leipzig, Stuttgart, and Munich, on the other hand, they will likely continue to exist for many years to come. Monetary policy is currently influenced by two arguments that provide contradictory implications, at least in the short term. Persistently high inflation, which suggests interest rate hikes, increasing macroprudential risks in the short term. We expect the interest rate peak later this year. This could be the starting signal for higher prices again. Politically and socially, CO2 emissions from buildings are increasingly coming into focus. In recent quarters, prices have already diverged between properties with low and high emissions. As the supply of energy-efficient buildings is likely to remain scarce, but demand is rising due to both regulatory requirements and increasing social significance, we expect even greater price divergence in the long term. 2023 Housing market outlook vdp Residential property price indices 1 2003100 1."

Depending on the jurisdiction, the focus varies from the narrower goal of hardening against physical risk, to full decarbonization. European countries are moving at different speeds, but all in the same direction. Policies in US states are diverging based on political dynamics. In Asia Pacific, the trend is mixed. Despite this variation, the events of 2022 have dramatically reinforced the need for action on climate change, both at the macro level of governments and industry and at the micro level of property-specific resilience and futureproofing. Investors should continue to plan and take action to adapt portfolios to evolving climate-related risks."

It all translates into fewer deals. One senior adviser to institutional investors said, Its pen- cils down in investment committee. We cant get an acquisition or disposition approved in investment committee at this time. The fundamental issue for many investors is how long the Fed will keep raising rates. Many people we consulted in the summer believed that the Fed will finish hiking by the end of 2022 and could start lowering again by mid-2023. However, Chairman Powells comments at the end of August led more observers to believe that relief will not come until at least 2024 and seemed to precipitate a sharp market selloff. But everyone agrees that deal volumes will not return until market players better understand the Feds playbookwhich, in turn, hinges on when inflation can be tamed. As the U. S. head of real estate at one investment bank explained, Thats going to create more clarity, and then some of the volatility comes down, and thats the opportunity to start buying. Deal flow will also require investors to recognize that pricing expectations have changed. Says one portfolio manager who wants to put money out now, I just dont know that sellers have capitulated enough to recognize the new environment."

But even current project developments cannot escape the changed framework conditions: many ongoing projects have to be re- evaluated, which may lead to price corrections. Mezzanine capital is being looked at more critically. Some project developments will certainly have to be restructured in terms of capital and project structure. Certain projects can no longer be profitable and will have to be terminated with a loss. In contrast, projects with good locations, top equipment and high design flexibility will survive. They might even benefit from declining supply. 3.

Thus, the government is turning off both the monetary and fiscal spigots that had been support- ing commercial real estate and the economy overall. The head of a development company summarized it like this: I feel like weve been on a little bit of a sugar high with this stimu- lus and cheap debt. Theres going to be a slowdown. Theres got to be this normalization. So, what does that mean? I think its going to be a little bouncy. Its going to be a little bit turbulent. But then we bottom out, and we start back into growth. 2.  Still, Weve Changed Some  The pandemic forced structural shifts in how and where we live, work, and recreate in ways that seem destinated to endure.  Online spending is receding from its pandemic peaks but is not likely to revert to pre-pandemic levels. Business travel is unlikely to recover to pre-COVID levels for at least several years, meaning business hotels, fine dining, and conference facilities will continue to face challenges.

The U. S. head of real estate banking for another major invest- ment firm sees office building quality more as a competitive advantage in the war for talent. Major companies, especially their headquarters space, think of that as synonymous with their brand. And so if they want to attract talent, they want to be at a modern, sustainable building. Those rents continue to hold up really well, says the head of a real estate investment bank. And everything else continues to be really, really tough. So its going to be trophy and trauma in the business. It is almost hard to overstate how much that older office product has fallen out of favor. A global portfolio man- ager of an investment management firm explains that office, especially value-add office, has kind of become toxic. The debt funds were the primary lender to value-add, especially opportu- nistic office. Thats completely dried up. As with failing retail centers, many of these older office assets will need to be either upgraded or converted, as discussed in our next trend on repurposing obsolete buildings. The biggest challenge is the enormous cost of renovating a 40-year-old building to the health and safety and sustainability features and modern design standards offered by the top-tier properties.

This is leading to an explo- sion in purchase prices for intermediate products and energy, on top of supply bot- tlenecks and a shortage of skilled workers which is being compounded by height- ened levels of sick leave at present. In addition, the unions are demanding much higher pay rises because of high inflation, at a time when industry is having to reduce production in view of the energy crisis and moreover, when it faces the threat of a significant recession. One consolation is that many companies still have well-filled order books."
index_300t_chunks:outlook-real-estatet-market-germany-dec-2022.pdf-!16,6,outlook-real-estatet-market-germany-dec-2022.pdf," Given the current macro environment, we believe that investor expectations of rental growth are not sufficiently high for this in any sector. The logistics market and the less regulated part of the residential market might be an exception. But here, too, the uncertainty about further developments is likely to be too great, at least temporarily. Another relevant lower edge for property yields is financing costs. At the end of the third quarter of 2022, prime yields in all major market segments were below the cost of debt capital . This situation could only persist if the number of equity buyers is sufficiently large. Indeed, such investors are currently quite active and are taking advantage of the lower prices for purchases. However, we think it unlikely that the existing equity volume will be sufficient to anchor prices below the cost of financing. The fact that the increase in initial yields is nevertheless likely to be comparatively flat is also due to the mostly comfortable financing situation on the part of the landlords. Apart from the project development segment, we expect few forced sales. We rule out a wave of non-performing loans like after the financial crisis. Nevertheless, the steep rise in interest rates is likely to put individual landlords under stress, especially in the value-add and opportunistic segments, where financing durations are typically short. Lower demand for space and rents due to the recession could jeopardise the implementation of the business plan and thus also refinancing."

Legislative proposals may involve a full elimination for real estate assets or a significant reduction to the value of real estate that may be exchanged tax-free. While full repeal is not currently in any legislative package and thus not likely, changes to this benefit would significantly impact the US real estate industry and should continue to be monitored. RECOMMENDATIONS Looking ahead to 2023, CRE leaders should aim to:  Prepare for increased transparency into reporting and increased data requirements for automated regulatory enforcement in certain jurisdictions.  Consider tax when planning for ESG initiatives. While much of the potential change to the global tax landscape could result in increased taxes, increased tax benefits are expected for ESG initiatives. In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 allows REITs and other non- tax-exempt entities to sell tax credits and exclude amounts received from such sale from gross income for tax purposes. This law allows REITs, which have largely not been able to benefit from ESG credits under existing laws since they rarely pay federal tax, to benefit from qualifying ESG activities. In Europe, real estate companies implementing ESG initiatives can look into various credits and incentives. For example, the European Commission has enhanced depreciation allowances for companies that invest in energy-efficient equipment."

Markets with high levels of construction include Dallas, Atlanta, the Inland Empire, Indianapolis, and Phoenix. As supply begins to come online, rent growth is expected to deceleratefirst, in untested sub- markets with elevated pipelines. Higher-barrier locations, on the other hand, may sustain higher rent growth for longer. Construction Is Battling Supply Chain Issues Real estate developers across the United States are confronting rising construction costs. Steel, concrete, and roofing materials contribute up to 80 percent of typical shell costs. Market price surges since the end of 2019 for these, and other major catego- ries, caused finished construction costs to spike by 50 percent. Construction durations in the broader industry have increased by two to three months, on average, since 2019, due to lon- ger material lead times and increasing contractor backlogs, according to a construction director at a large industrial owner. Advanced material procurement strategies and construction technology can resolve some ongoing construction issues. Developers are moving upstream in the value chain by lever- aging direct partnerships with national material suppliers to pre-secure and prioritize long-lead building materials and mitigate material shortages where possible. Developers are also introducing modularized construction systems to expedite repeatable project elements, such as office tenant improve- ments and in-warehouse restrooms, which reduce on-site construction timelines."
index_300t_chunks:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!3,2,isa-outlook-2023.pdf," The modern REIT era was launched in 1994, which provided much-needed equity and transparency to what had been a clubby, opaque business. In the US, private equity real estate recovered and put together a string of 14 years of strong returns, which took a Global Financial Crisis in 2008 to interrupt. In the UK, the boom-bust years in the early 1990s settled down as the Bank of England realized that lending to property developers required oversight. The result was a golden decade for British institutional real estate between 1996 and 2006, with 11 straight years of performance above the long-term IPD average. Even more incredibly, over the next 15 years real estate gradually became accepted as a global asset class, alongside equities and fixed income. Thirty years ago, the US and UK were the only two countries that had a decade of private equity property performance in a consistent and transparent manner. In the early 1990s, Australia and Canada were just getting their indices launched. Global REIT indices were still several years away and private equity indices in Japan, Germany and France were all still in the planning stages. The early 1990s also provided the launch pad for the first institutional-sized opportunity funds, which got going wherever real estate debt was in defaultwhich was just about everywhere."

In an August 2022 survey by the National Association of Business Economics, only a quarter of economists were even somewhat confident that the Fed could bring down inflation to its target range without causing a recession. Worrying signs out of Europe in early autumn and expectations of soaring heating bills this coming winter add to the gloomy global economic outlook. These conditions would be problematic for property markets: slowing or falling economic growth dampens tenant demand, while higher interest rates raise the cost of developing or acquiring properties. Both factors would cut returns and reduce values. Indeed, rising interest rates and uncertainty over future market conditions are already killing deals since sellers have not been ready to capitulate to buyers growing demands for price concessions, as we discuss in our capital markets trend. New Horizons Still, not all recessions are alike, and most economists, as well as Emerging Trends interviewees, expect any recession to be relatively short and shallow."

This is due to widened bid- ask spreads and reduced transaction activity.

Strategies that mitigate uncertainty focus on identifying assets for which the path of fundamentals is expected to be strong enough to compensate for the downside end of the range of plausible repricing scenarios."
index_300t_chunks:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!28,12,Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf," Tenants cannot afford to keep that empty space indefinitely, however, so office landlords should not be lulled into compla- cency by the relatively benign vacancy levels. More firms are downsizing or not renewing their expiring leases, so vacancy rates are still slowly rising, in contrast to every other major property sector. Plus, tenants are dumping unused offices by trying to sublet the space until their leases expire. Brokers report that a record level of office space is available for sublease, and more is hitting the market every quarter. Much of this space will eventually turn into outright vacancies as leases turn, unless firms eventually reverse course. But no one we interviewed expects a mass departure from office buildings. Even under the most pessimistic scenarios, most knowledge work will occur in company offices, which, after all, were designed to facilitate this high-value work. But it will take more time for firms to figure out how much space they will need, how it should be configured, and where it should be located.

Page 2 of 8 Our research team gives answers to some key questions facing real estate investors. To start with, we look at whether real estate prices currently fully reflect the move to higher interest rates and what prospects are for the market going forward. We also highlight opportunities for investors in the current environment, and what their strategy can be. We discuss how they can position their portfolios, and which sectors we think are the most defensive. We then look at prospects for the life sciences sector against a backdrop of slower VC funding. This follows a period of strong growth in the sector and a lot of investor interest. We also dive into student housing in the US, another sector booming among investors, and what impact demographic trends might have on it. In addition, we analyze how opportunistic and value-add managers will need to adopt their strategies now that interest rates are higher, and how their ability to generate out-size returns simply by adding leverage is gone. So, a number of important topics for us and investors to consider. We hope you find our answers insightful and useful in determining your strategy and thinking about some of the key questions in real estate as we move into the new year.

Significantly higher prices likely in the long term. Refurbishment costs are taken into account The boom is over. House prices are falling. Some indices show significant price declines, others are very restrained. The price expectations of potential buyers and sellers diverge. The number of transactions is very low. At current financing costs, prices would probably have to fall by about 20 from their peak to return to positive cash flow. However, five key arguments lead us to expect only a price dip. Negative real interest rates, inflation protection through real estate, rising rental growth and most importantly a high fundamental supply shortage. In addition, real house prices have already fallen very sharply due to the surge in inflation. Well-known price indices probably send different signals mainly due to different methods . The non-hedonic indices fall more sharply than the hedonic ones. Obviously, more properties in need of refurbishment have been changing hands in recent months. Housing remains in short supply. The interest rate shock is dampening new construction."

This is all the more true as legislators are loudly considering tightening up replacement and refurbishment obligations. The main price driver is the fundamental supply shortage. In 2023, according to our calculations, 59 of the 126 cities have higher demand than supply. The situation improves only slowly over the decade, according to our projections. In 2030, 35 cities still have a supply shortage. These are mainly the cities with high populations. The shortages are also likely to radiate to their neighbouring cities and entire regions. However, there are significant differences. The metropolitan areas with a high supply shortage over the entire decade include Berlin, Frankfurt, Hanover, Heidelberg, Cologne, Leipzig, Stuttgart, and Munich. According to our calculations, the supply shortage will end in 2025 in Dsseldorf and Hamburg, while the market has eased in Bremen and Nuremberg. For many years, we have pointed out in our housing market outlook that these cities are likely to have higher interest rate sensitivity. Now the litmus test is upon us. In addition to the fundamental supply shortage, there are a number of other factors that tend to raise prices. For example, adjusted for inflation, the price decline in 2022 was already very strong. In addition, the very negative real interest rates are currently an incentive to invest."

According to CW, the net prime yield for pro- perties with a large proportion of office space is 4 to 4.5. Lab offices are less appropriate for first-time investors in commercial real estate. Conversely, they can represent an interesting portfolio addition. High investment vo- lume in this young asset class is in any case virtually impossible given the limited si- ze of the market. However, growing demand is also likely to lead to higher invest- ment, for example as science and innovation centres are extended. The higher yield compared to top-tier office properties in the cities reviewed by CW is a positive as- pect, but not, in our view, the crucial factor. The higher yield is being achieved in a niche market with comparatively expensive speciality properties, most of which are also located outside city centres. Lab offices are interesting because of the high po- tential of life sciences and the consequently good rental prospects. Life science companies need labs urgently, and do not have the option of using clas- sic office properties or home working. The many adjustments needed to individual facilities speak for long-term tenancies. Moving to other premises would be very costly for the tenant. Research is also relatively unaffected by economic trends. It is the basis of the future economic success of a life science company, and is therefore likely to be the last area where savings are made."

Higher costs of living further pushed hourly wage workers out of the primary markets, and it remains unclear if they will ever return. While urban markets are finally starting to see increased demand for lodging, operators are not able to keep up with the guest volume potential due to continued staffing shortages. Properties have raised room rates on the reduced demand they can support, while service offerings remain limited, tainting guest satisfaction and blurring some hotels value proposition. Capital Markets and Transactions In the early months of 2022, buyers were eager to capitalize on the sectors performance recovery as weekly travel pat- terns started to normalize and urban markets started to show promising strides in recovery. The pent-up buyer demand had begun to translate to increased deal activity in the second half of 2021 and continued through mid-2022, with many institutional funds needing to place raised capital. According to Marcus Millichap, in the 12-month period ending June 2022, the number of deals completed was up over 40 percent from the prior 12 months.

Increasing supply is pressuring rents for larger office buildings in particular. Space reductions among tenants could indicate a shift towards more mobile workstations, which typically implies a need for less workspace per employee. Transaction levels in Q2 2022 rose by 10 compared with the same year-earlier period, but we expect a decline in transactions will become visible in the second half of the year. Office values and prime net yields have remained steady since Q4 2021, but office capital values are seen softening from H2 2022 for several quarters before stabilization and recovery take place. This will, in our view, happen earlier in the APAC region than in the European and U. S. office markets. Logistics Fundamental demand drivers such as e-commerce growth, supply chain reconfiguration and government (infrastructure) investment programmes are generally expected to continue during the outlook period. Vacancy rates in the more mature markets are very low and rental growth is forecast to remain positive in the three years to end-2025 at approximately 2.5 per annum. Q2 2022 valuations put capital values of prime logistics assets in the APAC area 5 above Q4 2021 levels, but a turning point is expected in the second half of 2022.

In addition, the legislation provides for hardship provisions and funding opportunities. These details show that the legislator is aware of the enormous challenge. The Modernization Package for Climate Protection and Planning Acceleration passed at the end of March also takes this into account. Greater openness to technology was agreed. For example, not only heat pumps are to be permitted, but also infrared and hybrid heating systems, such as a bivalent heat pump with a gas condensing boiler. In the long term, hydrogen will also remain an option. CO2 emissions are now to be taken into account to a greater extent in aggregated form across all sectors. Since emissions reductions in the building sector are relatively expensive, a missed target is more likely to be accepted here than in other sectors. According to the modernization package, however, the sector targets remain in place. The long-term target of a climate-neutral building stock in 2045 was also confirmed. Thus, only temporarily too high CO2 emissions may be accepted. Consequently, the pressure to refurbish remains high."

Real-world activities such as conferences, trade shows, exhibi- tions, weddings, sporting events, and other social gatherings could all be enhanced with the metaverse. Thus far, no one is predicting that the metaverse will replace brick-and-mortar properties, but the platform could, down the road, affect how people interact with physical locations. One of the biggest areas that the metaverse could affect is the workplace. The metaverse can enhance collaboration, com- plement the physical office, and improve the overall workplace PwC experience at a time when more workers are demanding flex- ible work arrangements. The metaverse could also be useful in helping firms build their employees professional skills at a time when everyone is hunting for employees.

Much of the vacancy growth has been concentrated in gateway market downtowns such as New York City and San Francisco, where vacancy rates rose by 8 to 10 percentage points. Suburban offices are faring better than downtown offices. Since early 2020, the office vacancy rate has shot up in downtowns while increasing only slightly in suburban areas. Its not that companies are moving offices from urban areas to the suburbs, but that fewer companies are downsizing in suburbs than in urban areas. There isnt a flight to the suburbs. It is more that companies are making space adjustments in urban areas, said one industry researcher. Some of the suburban growth comes from coworking space that provides a harbor for employees to get away from home or work in small teams. Whatever the location, a significant amount of office space is underused and potentially on the chopping block. Every corporate pronouncement about a return to the office has a corresponding announcement about permanent remote and or hybrid options for employees. With daily office usage down from pre-pandemic levels, some researchers predict a drop in demand of anywhere from 10 to 25 percent. For example, a report by a New York University team forecasts that demand for Manhattan office space will plummet, prompting values to drop by 32 percent over the short term and by 28 percent over the long term.

The lettings business has got over the Covid slump with rising rents and a halt to the rise in vacancies, and there might possibly have been an even stronger bounce-back in the office market without those dampening factors. What exactly is driving demand for office space? One aspect is likely to be a low take-up of leased office space in 2020 and 2021 be- cause of Covid in light of uncertainty surrounding the future trend and the conse- quences of working from home. This has now led to some catching up. In addition, there is a need to bring existing offices into line with the New Work concepts which have been drawn up in many companies and institutions. This means that some of- fices are being merged. Space that is no longer required or unsuitable is being given up, and new, suitable offices leased. Another reason behind the leasing of contemporary office space is the shortage of skilled workers, as we have already mentioned. If prospective employees are able to choose between several job offers, then they are likely to opt for the company offer- ing the most attractive work environment in a good location. In addition, employees, like companies, are paying more attention to sustainability. In light of climate change, it is important for companies to achieve a smaller carbon footprint  not least for the sake of their image."

This estimate is in line with our nationwide forecast. To this end, we have extrapolated the share of the 126 cities in new construction nationwide, which in the past was just over one-third, to 2030. The number of persons per household on a population-weighted basis across our 126 cities was 1.86 in 2011, declining very steadily to 1.80 persons in 2021. We continue this trend, causing the average household size to fall to 1.75 persons in 2030. The ratio is particularly low in A and C cities. There it is 1.72 persons. Similarly, it is significantly lower in eastern Germany at 1.8 than in the west at 2.3. This is probably mainly due to the relatively high vacancy rates in many eastern German cities. The fundamental supply shortage derived from these three variables was 133,800 apartments in 2022. It should increase to 167,500 by 2024 and then gradually decrease. From 2027 the supply shortage is eliminated in the 126 cities. By 2030 the cumulative housing surplus will continue to increase, but even in 2030 according to our calculations there will still be a supply shortage in 35 cities. In our housing market outlook for 2021 and 2022 this was the case in only 12 and 22 cities, respectively."

In spite of the energy crisis and supply bottlenecks, both the number of people in employment and the number of job vacancies are now up on pre-Covid levels. This is likely to reflect further demand for skilled workers in view of well-filled order books. Moreover, there are many unfilled posts in the public sector."

Given the high current uncertainty in the housing market, there may be current opportunities for both. 5.5 Anti-refurbishment strategy could also promise economic success Particularly for smaller companies, small landlords and investors, to whom the taxonomy applies but still has a relatively low impact, the new regulatory environment may also offer opportunities. This is because the considerable shortage of labor and skilled workers is likely to undermine the statutory replacement and remediation obligations to some extent. If, despite this, there is an increase in the sale of buildings with high emissions as a result of media coverage and social and political pressure, then they could be purchased cheap and renovations deliberately omitted. In the short term, it should thus be possible to achieve excess returns. We suspect that legislators will refrain from imposing a housing ban and the resulting stranded assets over the next few years, at least as long as housing is in short supply. Likewise, due to the normative power of the factual  the lack of labor  the judiciary is likely to be very reluctant to act. In the very long term, then, the success of this strategy depends primarily on the development of redevelopment costs. In the unfavourable case, costs rise disproportionately because the shortage of labor and skilled workers continues to worsen."

However, such build- ings are rare with a yawning gap between supply and demand. The shortage of modern office buildings is hardly likely to be remedied any time soon, and therefore office tenants will have to make do with often outdated existing buildings. In spite of high demand, office construction is just not getting off the ground. Although office completions across Germany have increased from a low of just 2 million m2 of floor space around ten years ago to around 3.2 million m2, this is not enough to fill the gap in supply which that has opened up. This is illustrated by the huge gap in relation to the number of construction permits issued which amount- ed to almost 5 million m2 in 2021. In addition, new building could ease off further as construction projects are delayed as they are on the housing front because of a shortage of building materials. New construction projects are also being shelved be- cause of higher financing costs and a sharp rise in the price of materials. Construc- tion costs in the office segment have increased by almost 30 per cent since the end of 2019.

However, persistently high inflation has already started to affect the affordability of index-linked rental properties and office tenants that are under pressure may seek to renegotiate their leases. The European office market is characterised by a large variety of rental contracts and if rental increases are staggered, for example, inflation cannot be passed on fully. At the time of writing, there is little market evidence of repricing of privately owned prime offices, but we estimate that average- quality office values may have fallen by roughly 15 by the end of Q4 2022 since their peak at the end of 2021. This amounts to a yield expansion of about 50bps. A yield correction is also on the cards for prime offices in Europe, but the increase is likely to be more moderate. Broker reports indicate that prime yields already started to move out in some locations between Q1 2022 and Q2 2022, with German cities leading the pack at 30bps. French and Spanish cities posted quarter-on-quarter yield increases of between 15 and 25bps. As risk-free rates are up and expected to remain elevated between 2023 and 2025, we believe office capital values could soften further during the outlook period, and we estimate prime yields in Europe will move out by another 50bps. This would amount to a value loss of around 10 to 15 before stabilization and recovery takes place."

Two thirds of city centre retail space was let to fashion, food and drink, grocery and healthcare and personal care businesses. Previously weak space demand in the textile sector picked up sharply, once again occupying peak position ahead of food and drink outlets. Conversely, the initial boom in the new quick commerce segment  grocery delivery services with very short delivery times  has lost momentum. In contrast, e-mobility providers more often have a presence in city centres. A whole series of foreign chains has also secured shops at the now lower rents. Inflation-adjusted retail sales continue to decline as in previous year City centre retail rentals stable in first quarter of 2022 Retailers, food outlets and other service providers who are undeterred by the difficult market conditions have the potential to rent attractive space at better terms than be- fore the pandemic.

As a result, year-over-year improve- ment in key performance indicators has been significantly stronger in these top 25 markets relative to the rest of the United States. Midweek Travel Starts to Normalize In the summers of 2020 and 2021, the leisure traveler was the primary driver of lodgings initial rebound, predominantly affecting drive-to markets and resort destinations. However, it is unclear whether this shift in demand will be permanent as international destinations continue to open back up and offer alternatives for the leisure traveler. These markets significantly increased in popularity during the pandemic due to their built-in outdoor activities , which are conducive to social distancing. As international outbound travel continues to increase with domestic travelers becoming more comfortable taking bigger, longer-distance trips again, this previously built-up demand in drive-to leisure and resort destinations may be disrupted. Midweek travel patterns have begun to show promising strides toward a more sustained recovery, largely propelled by the group and business segments."

Investors should be patient but prepared to act as opportunities materialize. In the meantime, floating rate debt investment at defensive loan-to-value ratios represents an attractive strategy. Debt re- pricing is nearly instantaneous, while equity re-pricing takes time.

There are negative implications as well: as single-family rentals become more prevalent, they could become a competitor to traditional for-sale homes. The nascent stage of the industry makes the future hard to determine, but one ought to consider the following:  Nearly half of all master-planned communities are planning a build-for-rent section.  Thirty-five percent of single-family renters with budgets of $1,000-plus per month rent by choice.  Single-family renters with rent budgets of $1,000-plus per month prefer to rent for more flexibility, as well as for less maintenance and fewer financial responsibilities, than they would have as homeowners. 47 focused on supply chain optimization and less on absorb- ing additional space, other users are stepping up to secure additional space. E-commerce will continue to drive logistics demand for the foreseeable future with growing diversity. Demand Still Outpaces Inventory Given persistent stock-outs, rapidly rising prices, and unreli- able supply chains, the need for higher inventories increased. Inventory growth was rapid in the six months from February through July 2022, up 9 percent on a net basis for wholesale and retail. Although inventories are up, they continue to lag sales."

After all, the trend of working from home as a hybrid form of working  which smartly combines presence and absence in the traditional office  reduces the need for space in total, but it also increases focus on the requirements for top office space with the aforementioned characteristics. Ulrich Hller on the purchase price development for office and business properties: We have already seen an adjustment of purchase prices for commercial real estate  with substantial discounts compared to the peak in the second half of 2021, of up to 20 per cent depending on the quality and location of the property. The very top properties are most resilient to this trend. Residential real estate sales have also slowed significantly and become more difficult: potential buyers are unsettled and largely inactive due to the market and financing developments. Ulrich Hller on the future behaviour of real estate investors: The fact is that the majority of institutional investors are currently holding back on investments in real estate. However, the development of interest rate levels points to an easing of the situation. For the second quarter of 2023, we therefore expect the market and commitments to pick up again. At that point, Germany will come back into focus as an investment location  not so much as a safe haven, but because the lower entry level and the strong dollar will offer attractive yield opportunities."

This figure from an institutional real estate manager depicts a set of aggregate risk scores generated by three different climate risk analytics providers for assets , dem- onstrating the challenge of translating complex climate science into business decisions. Considerations might include market value, the assumed percentage change in value, capital repair estimates, replace- ment cost, assumed business interruption loss, or assumed mitigation costs. Indirect considerations, such as ownership structure, structure of the capital stack, lease considerations, and insured amount, may or may not be factored in. Needless to say, it is easy to see why a wide variation in prediction patterns is prevalent across providers. Improving Decision-Making with Climate Risk Analytics To overcome these challenges of variability between climate risk analytics providers outputs, it is necessary for institu- tional real estate managers to carefully articulate their use case needsspecifically regarding valuation and value-at- risk. The climate risk analytics provider community can, in turn, benefit from sharing more about their approaches and the strengths and limits of models and physical risk data. To the extent that these conversations can be continuous and earnest, they will help guide both industries forward.

Excluding the impact of inflation on spending shows that travel trips fell even more, since the number of meetings and events dropped by almost 80 percent. A summer 2022 study conducted by Tourism Economics for USTA forecasts that U. S. business travel in 2022 will get back to only 73 percent of 2019 levels and will not return to pre-pan- demic levels through at least 2026. Firms are restricting travel to save on costs, and employees are reluctant to travel anyway. Of greater importance, they have less need to travel since clients are often unwilling to interact in person, and many industry conferences have either been canceled or moved online. But perhaps the core issue is that after working from home for so long, we have learned to conduct business remotely, facilitated by improved meeting technology.

index_300t_chunks:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!30,9,isa-outlook-2023.pdf," It is tempting to suggest that such value hits for favored sectors may signal that sector differences are close to fully priced and that the performance gaps between property types will narrow going forward. Intuitively, this feels like it should be the case at some point. Assuming an efficient market, we should not expect to see a single factor drive persistent outperformance over many years. However, our proprietary fair value analysis suggests that, for the most part, the favored sectors retain strong relative value. That said, we are also seeing widening gaps within sectors, some granular and others glaring, that we expect will also drive divergent performance going forward. Because of these divides, investment traits beyond the property typelike location, asset quality, covenant strength and supply barriersare thus likely to rise in relative importance for investors portfolios in 2023. For example, a likely economic slowdown means it will be necessary to get granular about land constraints in favored sectors. This is definitely the case in industrial. We are most upbeat about logistics markets that face barriers to new supply, such as urban submarkets in Europe, cities with greenbelt restrictions like Toronto and markets with near-zero vacancy rates and dwindling land supply like Sydney. Even in a softer macroeconomic environment, landlords are likely to face upward pressure on rents in segments with acute supply barriers. Moreover, asset quality divides within sectors are rapidly gaining in significance. This is in part due to evolving expectations of the role of real estate."

In past housing market outlooks, we defined reaching the 80 percentile, which is around 120 index points for both indices, as a point of reference for a potential end to the house price cycle. In principle, this rule of thumb has proved helpful. The OECD database also allows the length of house price cycles to be calculated. Based on inflation-adjusted price indices, the cycle lasted 53 quarters from the second quarter of 2009 to the second quarter of 2022. Adjusted for inflation, German house prices increased by 62 and by 103 in nominal terms. According to our methodology, the German cycle was the ninth longest cycle in the OECD database. 3. Fundamental supply shortage in Germany and in our 126 cities is declining 3.1 High additional demand due to immigration The influx of war refugees has increased Germany's population to 84.3 million.

The borders are likely to remain open even if the war ends soon, Ukrainian GDP collapsed by 35 in 2022 according to the IMF, it is likely to shrink again this year, and the per capita income gap between Ukraine and Germany was already about one in ten before the war.

However, it remains to be seen whether this actually happens. Households are being hit hard by high inflation and especially by the rise in energy prices. The latter is also affecting the economy which teeters on the brink of a recession, which in turn could dampen the labour market and hence household incomes.

For example, Washington, D. C. imposes a tax on vacant buildings of $5 per $100 of assessed value, while blighted properties are taxed at $10 per $100 of value. Vancouver, British Columbia, is believed to be the first city in North America to impose a vacancy tax, enacted in 2017 to combat widespread pied--terre ownership. While the tax did raise funds for affordable housing initiatives, skeptics point out that the tax apparently did not cause empty condominiums to be converted into active rental units. Oakland, California, enacted a flat vacant property tax of $6,000 tax on houses and nonresidential properties and $3,000 on con- dominium units in use less than fifty days in a calendar year. Berkeley and San Francisco are considering adopting versions, while several other cities have considered them in recent years Inclusive and Equitable Growth: The Emergence of Impact Investing within Institutional Real Estate In recent years, institutional investors and corporations have announced billions of dollars worth of capital commitments targeted at addressing socioeconomic inequity, particularly with respect to bridging the racial wealth gap.

It is now equally critical, however, that new capital deploy- ment strategies be developed to support much more than simple sufficiency."

All of these positive and negative factors together paint a kind of a Rorschach test, where observers can draw their own conclusions as to the strength of the economy. The End of the Beginning But there is one issue on which our interviewees agree: The exis- tential risk for the real estate economy right now is that Fed action in response to persistent inflation will tip us into a recession, says a senior partner with a leading advisory firm. But can the Federal Reserve Bank tame inflation without breaking the economy? Moderating inflation rates this summer led many to believe that the worst was over and that the Fed could soon ease up its con- tractionary monetary policy. Indeed, the consensus of experts we interviewed this summer was that the Fed would cease tightening by the end of 2022 and start cutting rates again in mid-2023. That sentiment now appears optimistic. Inflation is going to be a little stickier than people think, said an investment banking executive we interviewed during the summer, whose views turned out to be more prescient. Sentiment started changing in late August when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell gave his annual speech to fellow central bankers affirming the Fed view that infla- tion is not nearly under control, jolting markets. Any remaining doubt about that was quashed by the official Fed commentary accompanying their September rate announcement projecting that rates would keep rising through 2023."

Employees are cashing in on low unemployment rates, a rising cost environment, and more jobs offering remote working options. When hiring or retaining employees, CRE companies should consider the desire to work remotely as a long-term talent trend. When looking forward to the next 12 to 18 months, 68 of respondents in our survey expect their companys overall headcount to increase or stay consistent. However, nearly 50 of respondents from firms larger than US$20 billion assets under management (AUM) say their firms need to lower headcount slightly in the coming year. Meanwhile, 44 of respondents from smaller firms say they plan to increase headcount slightly. Understanding employee expectations will be important in managing recruitment and retention. More than 40 of respondents expect to bolster DEI initiatives, add additional health and wellness benefits, and offer regular remote working options. But only about a third are prioritizing measures such as workplace redesigns, implementing flexible schedules, and offering more career growth and skill development . These are areas CRE firms should continue pursuing to help enhance the talent experience. Workplace redesign and flexibility are important as well.

Uneven trajectories could force the industry in new directions. A few trends that industry leaders should consider as they construct, consolidate, or reallocate their portfolios:  Tenant expectations and how many use spaces have evolved dramatically. With increasing rent levels, occupiers are now typically looking for high-quality, efficient spaces to match sky- high premiums. To better attract and retain tenants, owners and investors can enhance tenant experiences by leveraging data analytics, and more specifically, special intelligence tools, which can allow tenants to personalize their spaces to maximize productivity.48  Most respondents continue to have well-founded concerns about supply chain disruptions and construction costs due to construction delays and soaring land and materials costs. To address supply constraints, CRE leaders should focus on creative property-use conversions and targeted location strategies that tap into shifting demographic gateways.  Sources of funding may pull back in the near term as firms reassess their risk tolerance as they face volatile market conditions. Real estate owners and investors seeking capital should consider creative, alternative sources, such as looking outside of native jurisdictions for partnerships or approaching debt funds. Survey respondents primary concerns for property fundamentals in the coming months surround sources of funding and the corresponding impact on overall transaction activity."

Survey respondents were asked to share their opinions on their organizations growth prospects and forward plans for workforce, operations, technology, and culture. We also asked about their investment priorities and anticipated structural changes in 2023. Respondents were equally distributed among three regionsNorth America , Europe , and AsiaPacific . The survey included real estate companies with assets under management of at least US$100 million and was completed in June 2022. Overall, respondents indicated that sustained high inflation, workforce management, cyber risk and climate-related regulatory action are most likely to impact revenue prospects for the next 1218 months ."
index_300t_chunks:2023_Housing_market_outlook__Price_dip_and_interes.pdf-!78,18,2023_Housing_market_outlook__Price_dip_and_interes.pdf," Given the high debt levels in many euro countries, they are likely to remain structurally low, probably negative. In this case, borrowers can let inflation work for them, which means they have to pay back less purchasing power than they have borrowed. Another factor is inflation protection. In periods of high inflation, house and apartment prices increased faster than inflation. This is likely to be the case this time as well, especially against the backdrop of the high supply shortage. Last but not least, rents are starting to pick up. Admittedly, the strict regulatory environment argues against strong rent increases. But the increase in short-term rentals, furnished rentals and the likely strong rise in the share of index rents point to higher rent growth. The relative risk position also makes the German housing market attractive. For example, although prices are currently falling, the declines are small compared with the stock and bond markets. Since house and apartment prices historically rise with inflation, the residential real estate market should also be more attractive for institutional investors in the long term than the bond market, which may yield a higher cash flow but generally does not offer inflation protection. Furthermore, the residential real estate market is again likely to be significantly less cyclical and dependent on rate changes than the commercial real estate market. Last but not least the German residential market is less overvalued than many other residential markets in terms of income and rents according to OECD indices."
index_300t_chunks:2023_Housing_market_outlook__Price_dip_and_interes.pdf-!69,16,2023_Housing_market_outlook__Price_dip_and_interes.pdf," In particular, households with relatively high incomes are likely to consider low-emission rental housing. In this case, rent increases should also be easier to implement. It is unclear to what extent higher prices and rents will cover the costs of new construction or renovation. However, if the heat turnaround is to succeed, the state is likely to provide more incentives here again in the future. Both the draft amendment to the Building Energy Act and the modernization package hold out the prospect of subsidies. An ideal time for renovation could therefore be as soon as the subsidy situation brightens and the German government launches new subsidy programs. The current construction recession and falling material costs may also provide an opportunity to place orders. Also, due to presumably significantly higher wages as a result of the worsening shortage of labor and skilled workers, early refurbishment is recommended. Moreover, as described, we expect demand to outstrip supply of refurbished properties for many years to come. The frontrunners are therefore likely to achieve not only lower refurbishment costs, but also higher prices and rents, and thus higher returns overall. It is also advisable to develop a refurbishment strategy. Properties that are easy to refurbish are probably a better starting point than buildings with high emissions, where emissions reduction is often disproportionately expensive. The focus is likely to be on serial renovations in particular. Once positive experience has been gained with the new method, economies of scale could reduce costs substantially."

In a sense, this is the reversal of the post-financial crisis environment, Text: Matthias Pink und Matti Schenk Introduction We have to be prepared to live in a future where everything is different than before. You cant get more uncertain than that. This sentence was uttered by the Egyptologist Jan Assmann, someone who has spent his life studying human history. His before spans millennia, not just one or two real estate cycles, and that gives his statement all the more weight. So, the future seems extraordinarily open, perhaps more open than ever. For long-term decisions, and that includes real estate decisions, this is the worst possible environment.

This is reflected in consumer sentiment which has fallen to a historic low. The GfK survey shows that income expectations have slumped to an even greater degree than the propensity to buy. This is bad news for city centre retail in two respects, with the need to make savings driving consumer spending down further. Nominal wages are rising comparatively strongly in 2022, however the growth is being more than offset by high inflation, probably of an annual average rate close to 8 per cent. Below the line, spending power is falling significantly, much more steeply than in the last three decades. While low inflation has supported retail activity since 2012 in the form of real wage growth, the opposite is now the case. Busy shopping centres and restaurants convey a different picture. However, house- holds are reluctant to spend. The German Federal Statistical Office reported an infla- tion-adjusted decline of 9 per cent in retail sales in June 2022 compared to the same month last year."

Taking into account energy-related refurbishment costs for existing properties is likely to explain the divergence. During the housing boom the state of renovation and the energy certificates played a much smaller role. Today, properties that have not been refurbished or have been refurbished to a minor extent are regularly traded at a discount. In the long term, the discount is likely to increase. On the supply side, the shortage of labor and skilled workers is likely to intensify over the decade as a whole. As a result, the ambitious new construction and refurbishment targets will be difficult to achieve. On the demand side, the rise in energy prices and the consideration of the costs of climate change are likely to lead to a shift away from buildings with high emissions and toward low-emission buildings. The CO2 tax is already making energy costs more expensive. In the next few years, the EU taxonomy will require larger companies and institutional investors to publish their ESG footprint annually. The way companies generate profits will thus come into focus. Consumers and the public can then vote with their feet in a more targeted way and denounce misconduct or persistent underperformance, which in turn is likely to have an impact on corporate performance. For example, the green asset ratio, the share of sustainable investments in all investments, must be published."

And still others dont fit neatly into traditional CRE categories, like media , cell towers, and data centers, but all benefit from solid demand. Some investors introduce niche products to add diversification to their portfolios. Says a senior adviser to institutional investors, I like, within certain traditional segments, playing off the niche a little bit. Medical office is an interesting offset to traditional office exposure in a portfolio. And you have the same thing happening with other major property types like industrial with cold storage and data centers. In summary, real estate investors are viewing calendar year 2022 as a transitional year requiring changes in near-term investment tactics. Some capital has moved to the sidelines until there is greater clarity on pricing and future market conditions. But investors still actively seeking opportunities are generally seeking the safety of top-quality assets or sectors most likely to ride out expected headwinds due to strong demographic sup- port or other favorable demand fundamentals. 6. Finding a Higher Purpose  Long-term demographic trends and more recent structural demand shifts have rendered countless existing buildings and properties either redundant or obsolete. Many of these buildings may ultimately need to be repurposed or upgraded to meet new market requirements.  Key repositioning targets are concentrated among retail, office, and older industrial structures and sites."

More than 50 of respondents say their firms are committing hard dollars to piloting, early implementation, or in-production initiatives to bring these capabilities to life. Firms should not dismiss these technologies as fads. Commit efforts to investigate how these technologies can complement and enhance your existing services. 26 The winding road ahead ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL uncertainty have made the path forward murkier. Following a pandemic-fueled course correction, the global real estate industry faces transformational shifts in how buildings are used, valued, and transacted. And frequent shifts in the global economy could impact the industry even more. Operating with a business-as-usual approach should be long behind us. Real estate firms should make informed, innovative plans to meet the evolving needs of investors, tenants, and regulators alike. The road map will likely vary significantly based on firm size, subsector, and location. Office owners in Europe might face different realities than data center investors in AP or logistics developers in North America. Understanding and responding to change is only part of the solution. CRE leaders should also focus on smart implementation. They can leverage an engaged and increasingly remote workforce to help keep operations efficient and effective."

Based on data from Pitchbook,global venture capital invested into life sciences companies in 2022 is set to fall by around 25 on the volume recorded in 2021. With so much hype around the sector, we need to consider what the potential implications are for life sciences real estate markets. 2021 was a stand-out year when a perfect storm of ultra- cheap capital fueled a boom in risk asset investments. At the same time, the spotlight was on the healthcare sector as the pandemic raged on. But despite the financial market turmoil, based on data from the VC funding level in 2022 is still on track to be the second highest on record. There is still liquidity to support growing life sciences companies, but the investment criteria is more stringent. Companies with strong data sets that can demonstrate a clear path in their RD or progress in trial phases to unlock returns for investors at the next funding round are still finding financial backers. The supply side still lags well behind the level of demand in most markets. There are significant pent-up requirements which havent been satisfied by the volume of supply coming through.

However, unlike the US, the major driver of European inflation is an exogenous energy price shock, rather than rampant domestic demand. The ECB and BoE will continue to raise interest rates to defend currencies to avoid importing more inflation and to manage the inflationary effects of Europes tight labor markets. However, with core price pressures less pronounced than in the US and weaker long-term demographic drivers of inflation in Europe, it is likely that both the peak level and equilibrium rate of monetary policy will be lower in Continental Europe than in the US. Nevertheless, for the moment the repricing pressure on Europes lowest-yielding property sectors is profound. Buyers not using leverage have an opportunity to set pricing at the margin and they have been among the few active players. However, the opportunity cost of doing so given the returns on offer in other asset classes, such as fixed income, means that real estate capital markets will likely stall until bid- ask spreads narrow further. Capitulation is more likely to come from sellers than buyers.

Virtually no large interconnected office space was available from the existing stock and most rental contracts were therefore for project develop- ments. However, the pandemic - which made working from home acceptable in Germany - led to a weakening of rental business. Rents stopped rising, and the number of vacant properties increased.  Rental activity has gained pace again since the end of 2021. Office space is also in demand again. Appropriate office space is needed for the new hot desking office concepts now being adopted by many companies. Because contemporary office space is still in short supply, rents are correspondingly high, and prime rents for high-end and sustainable office space are therefore increasing again. Interest in office properties with low energy efficiency, on the other hand, is likely to wane among tenants and investors alike.  However, with the German economy at risk of recession, the headwind for office rentals is clearly intensifying. The upward rent trend could therefore flatten once again."

Housing markets In the housing markets, the new macro environment has probably changed the outlook most seriously. The demand for rental housing has by no means weakened, as seemed to be foreseeable at the beginning of the year. Due to the influx of Ukrainian refugees, Germanys population has risen to over 84 million people for the first time. In addition, current population forecasts, such as the one by Deutsche Bank, assume a high immigration rate in the future and thus a continued increase in demand for housing. Due to the sharp rise in financing costs, many households can no longer afford to buy their own home and remain tenants. While demand for rental housing is unexpectedly high, conversely, construction completion figures must be assumed to be falling instead of rising."

Costs and Capital: Navigating a Period of Price Discovery amid Major Market Shifts for Canadian Real Estate Things are changing so quickly. . Developers are not panicking, just pausing. While overabundance of capital was a significant concern last year, the sentiment has changed in 2022, with some interview- ees expecting continuing challenges in 2023. Whereas the We can see the impacts in our survey results, in which respon- dents identified interest rates and costs of capital as the top economic issue for real estate in 2023. We also saw a significant rise in the number of respondents saying that both equity capital and debt capital are undersupplied. Pressure on Institutional Capital Increasing Uncertainty While some interviewees suggested that capital is still available for top-quality borrowers or projects, other factors remain that may hinder the market for the time being. Consider, for example, institutional investors allocations to real estate. While these have been rising in recent years, events in 2022 could reverse that trend."

Hurricane Ian was the fifth-strongest hurricane to make landfall in the United States and may prove to be the costliest in history. Severe damage, including complete destruction, has occurred to real estate in the storms path. Even properties that were relatively undisturbed were left cut off from road access, power, internet, water and even mobile service due to damaged infrastructure. A forceful hurricane season in 2022 was preceded by a sweltering summer in the Northern Hemisphere. Europe and China recorded their hottest-ever summers since recordkeeping began in 1880, according to NOAAs National Centers for Environmental Information. Meanwhile, Japan and the US recorded their second- and third-hottest summers, respectively. Knock-on economic effects included the pausing of railway service in Britain and the disruption of goods traffic on rivers in Europe and China due to low water levels. Events such as these reinforce how critical it is that investors evaluate the extent to which physical climate risk hazards may directly impact real estate portfolios and harden buildings to make them resilient to climate change. Unfortunately, the range of tools to measure and predict climate events remains immature.2 Despite inconsistencies in the data, there is no time to waste. It is critical to move beyond data collection and dashboarding, to incorporating climate risk into investment and portfolio decisions."

In our view, three aspects come into play here. Firstly, the volume of completed space will be comparatively high, at least in the next two years, and will ensure a greater supply of modern office space. Secondly, the economic downturn will, at least temporarily, bring the cost side back into sharper focus for companies - this will also influence their willingness to pay for office space. Thirdly, and this is presumably the strongest effect, the increased demands on office space quality are offset by a lower quantitative demand. According to our impression, at least most large users want to significantly reduce their per capita office space footprint against the backdrop of the hybrid working world that is becoming established. We think it is unlikely that this will be compensated by a rising number of office employees. In the short term the economic development stands in the way and in the long term demographics. In view of this mix, downward pressure on rents is likely to increase. Away from the top segment, we expect rents to fall in the coming year. The top segment may be able to escape this development against the backdrop of the ESG issue. Since some occupiers only rent space that is ESG-compliant, it is not in competition with other space. Consequently, the rents of modern spaces could decouple from the rest of the market."
index_300t_chunks:global-real-estate-markets-2023.pdf-!2,2,global-real-estate-markets-2023.pdf," This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy. Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs. We have already started to see cap rates and yields rise in many markets, with the most rapid adjustment taking place in the UK. However, we do not think that prices fully reflect higher interest rates yet. To assess when values might bottom out, we can look to past downturns and the listed market for guidance. In the Global Financial Crisis, for example, global capital values bottomed out in 4Q09, while GDP across global real estate markets troughed three quarters earlier, in 1Q09, as did global listed real estate prices1. Market downturns usually present opportunities, and one we expect for investors in 2023 is a correction in pricing as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. Although we do not expect large amounts of distress in the market, we do expect some, already apparent in parts of the UK market. This should allow investors access to assets at attractive pricing. The early 1990s downturn was longer, with US capital values continuing to decline into 1995. We expect modest declines in GDP in the first half of 2023 before growth resumes."

As the industry grows, the single-family rental space can serve as a living laboratory for reducing cycle times, according to the CEO of a national firm specializing in residential architec- ture. As single-family rental operators design new floor plans and build hundreds of houses at a time , the industry can modernize and become more precise. The repetition will allow for innovation and ultimately reduced cycle times that could, in the end, solve the problem of affordability faster than expected. So, it is possible that the housing issues raised by the pandemic could result in industry improvements that outlive it."
index_300t_chunks:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!21,6,isa-outlook-2023.pdf," As such, evidence of the most significant repricing to date has been concentrated in the lowest- yielding sectors, where transactions have held up most. This has surprised some observers since these low-yielding property types are mostly the winning sectors of recent years and they continue to possess attractive growth profiles. That some of the largest recent value declines may be occurring in the most sought- after property types, such as logistics and residential, might come as a shock after years of banner outperformance, especially during the pandemic. Even so, these property types remain the strongest performers over longer trailing periods and values have also fallen in the less favored sectors, although such adjustments are masked by lower price transparency in these property types. This repricing has been labeled mechanical by some because it is a function of exogenous debt assumptions increasing in investors spreadsheets. An alternative way to look at it is that it is mechanical because debt pricing is a mechanism by which real estate is linked to the broader capital markets, through lenders cost of funds. Another such mechanism is the denominator effect. This involves comparing real-time values from public markets to lagging valuation-based assessments of private market portfolios, causing some investors to conclude that they are suddenly overweight in the unlisted assets compared to their target allocation. Either way, the downward direction of the pricing pressure is clear and it will likely persist as long as the all-in cost of debt is dilutive to leveraged returns. Given the same inputs, the math works the same way all over the world."

Build to rent (BTR) strategies in Australia are gaining traction, and supply is set to grow rapidly in relative terms over the outlook period. In absolute terms, however, BTR is still very rare and forms a very limited part of the overall stock. The accessibility and affordability of some cities are cause for growing concern.

A catchment area of 2.4 million potential customers and a large volume of day-trippers from the Benelux countries are an at- tractive prospect for retailers. However, tourism was not quite as important before Covid as in other top locations. Spending power is also moderate for a top location at 104 points. Unlike Dsseldorf with its distinctive luxury segment, Cologne city centre is focused on lower-end retail. A three kilometre shopping circuit encourages a stroll through prime locations and boosts footfall. One particular example is Schildergasse, the location for many chain store branches. Footfall is also high in Hohe Strae, but below the high levels of Schildergasse. Conversely, Ehrenstrae is a trendy location.

One developer says, The average deal for us used to take 90 days to close, and now its over six months. Some experts we interviewed believe that the rise of single- family rentals (SFRs) also contributes to declining affordability of for-sale housing. Proponents argue that SFRs extend the opportunity to live in a single-family house to those who cannot afford to buy or just dont want to, while generally expanding the supply of rental housing. But critics point out that institutional capital is driving up prices in the resale market, in the words of one housing adviser, by outbidding owneroccupant homebuy- ers for existing homes. One reason: existing tax laws are stacked against the individual homebuyer. Explains one academic, Investors are allowed to not only deduct everything, but also they can depreciate the unit. They also have access to lower cost of capital. In sum, institutional buyers assembling horizontal apartment portfolios can afford to pay more to be the high bidder for homes. And they do. Investors account for one in five homebuyers, up by a third compared with before the pandemic.

One factor con- tributing to the tight labor market is retirements by those older than the core-age cohort, and with Canadas population aging, we can expect these demographic trends to add to the chal- lenges experienced by sectors like the construction industry. So, what can we do about this?

Builders have not had time to create new designs, but they are modifying current ones. The CEO of a large private homebuilder noted that consumers prefer a higher bedroom count , so in many instances he is choosing existing plans with those features. His team also puts in reading nooks and drop zones where they can, often using space taken away from larger spaces. Architects are reporting similar adjustments. Three significant trends include the following:  More function in the same-sized home. Spaces added include an extra bedroom and additional flex or office spaces. To fit in the extra functions, architects are taking space from typically large areas like the kitchen or dining room and right-sizing the home office and making additional flex spaces that serve as additional work space.

Their ascendance as talent and, increasingly, leadership within the workforce will likely lead to a heightened focus on finding solutions to these disparities. Their voices have been amplified by social media, and they are increasingly holding corporations, investors, and governments more accountable for mitigating negative externalities that have been imposed on society. Many recognize certain risks that come with wealth and income disparity. Growth potential may be disrupted by social unrest and political instability that often accompany inequality as those on the bottom see less opportunity available to them. A more promising, evolving school of thoughtimpact investingshifts focus away from simply limiting downside toward creating upside. While the definition of impact will vary by investor, this deliberately inclusive form of capitalism focuses on unlocking the potential of people and places that have been historically overlooked and underserved. Looking through a dual lens of purpose and profit, measurable impact and equitable outcomes are central to this investment strat- egy. This stands in stark contrast to how investors have often viewed social responsibility in the pastas a tangential and philanthropic nice to have, but not a must-have. Increased transparency has contributed to the evolution of impact investing."

Scalable solutions must be cre- ated that allow more people to thrive, not just survive. It appears that many of these corporations and investors are struggling with how, where, and with whom to deploy that capital. Industry leaders have not yet coalesced around solutions to address inequity that are innovative, replicable, and scalable. The 1977 Community Reinvestment Act initiated a wave of investment targeted at meeting some of the basic needs of low- and moderate-income communities. The passage of the act was an important step aimed at reversing years of inten- tional disinvestment caused by practices such as redlining and blockbusting. In my view, it was a recognition that capital should be deliberately directed to address the needs of low-income individuals: all members of society deserve to be afford- ably housed, have enough food to eat, and have access to employment that allows them to address at least their most basic needs. It is critical that society continue to support its most vulnerable. The distribution of that prosperity within America has become increasingly inequitable, and socioeconomic mobil- ity has become less and less attainable for Americans in the lower and middle classes. Indeed, despite the longest economic expansion in U. S. history through much of the 2010s, the Gini index reached 0."

Regulation to Address Housing Affordability and Blight Rent control. Regulation is something that should be top of mind for a lot of property owners. And were starting to see significantly more rent control laws being passed at the local and municipal levels. That does have trickle-down impacts to individual property owners. That warning comes from the head of advisory services for a real estate data analytics firm. As shelter costs increasingly strain household budgets, some state and local governments are resorting to regulation to address affordability. This takes two primary forms: limits on how much landlords can increase rents and imposing costs on owners who keep units empty. At present, only California and Oregon, plus the District of Columbia, have statewide rent con- trol, although about 25 municipalities in California impose their own laws. Four other statesMaine, Maryland, New Jersey, and New Yorkallow some or all local governments to enact local own regulations but have no statewide law. Most other states either expressly preempt rent control or limit home rules that would allow it. That could soon change, however."

Ironically, the affordability challenges extend to a subgroup we call the Affordable West. These markets are, indeed, more affordable than the ultra-pricey West Coast markets, especially those in California. But population growth has outpaced hous- ing development, pushing up home prices faster than local incomes. Much of the population growth in these markets has been fueled by the in-migration of households seeking more affordable housing, suggesting that growth could soon slow in some of these markets, absent an easing in home prices. On the other hand, the three market subgroups that experi- enced the greatest relative rating improvements over the last year all have relatively affordable housing .

But until that occurs, properties will be offered on the hope that aspirational pricing targets anchored on peak levels will be achieved and a bid-ask gap will persist. Our expectation is that transaction activity will be below average in 2023, but start to recover in some sectors later in the year. While unleveraged buyers are not directly impacted by higher interest rates, they are also shifting their pricing and buying activity. They are adjusting their cost of capital in response to the broader capital markets, and unleveraged or low-leverage buyers are capital constrained as well. Higher interest rates have hurt the value of investors broader investment portfolios, triggering the so-called denominator effect, contributing to less competitive and less aggressive pricing for real estate.

This has led to high demand in the housing market, an ever dwindling supply and hence, a sharp rise in rents. However, popula- tion growth in large cities has ground to a halt. The number of inhabitants has been stagnating or even falling since 2019. The reasons for this are a Covid-led decline in immigration into Germany up to 2021 and exodus of families to the surrounding countryside. The influx has increased significantly in 2022, though, above all through the war in Ukraine. However, the impact on housing is difficult to qualify and, in particular, it is virtually impossible to say how long these refugees will stay.

That resiliency is best demonstrated by the wild swing in retail demand that has occurred since 2020. The sector set records in terms of bankruptcies and closures in the wake of the pan- demic.

Other chains accelerated right-sizing plans, expanded already planned strategic closures, or withdrew from the marketplace completely. Meanwhile, the categories hit hardest were those that had been e-commerce-resistant bright spots of the retail landscape prior to the pandemic. Service retail from restaurants to fitness clubs and from experiential to entertainment concepts faced the great- est challenges.

A wave of charging options paired with renewable energy storage methods will impact multifamily and retail in the coming years. Net-zero disclosure requirements are expected to increase, which will put pressure on landlords to offer ways of tracking energy consumption and carbon emissions by tenant. To do this, asset owners may opt to develop a digital twin of their asset that collects real time information from thousands of sensors in the building. Governments will ramp up subsidies to incentivize less wasteful development and greener buildings. The largest government programs spend subsidies via the private lending community that will do a green assessment in exchange for lower financing costs at origination. However, we may see increased pressure by regulators to also monitor the asset during the loans life, further increasing the need for a standard tech solution. The sector is also captive for taxation when governments eventually look to pay down debts built up over the pandemic.

Recognizing that government funding is often inflexible, inefficient to obtain, and insufficient, it is critical that state, local, and federal governments continue to focus on lowering the cost of capital for private investments in low- and moderate-income communities. Institutional inves- tors will likely need to be further incentivized to increase their allocations outside the major metropolitan areas that have traditionally been the primary beneficiaries of institutional capital flows. Public policy that deconcentrates poverty, reduces barriers to the creation of affordable and attainable housing, and incentiv- izes the development of mixed-income neighborhoods with deliberate infusions of social capital warrants additional con- sideration.

On average, the office yield was more than 300 basis points above the bond yield between 2008 and 2021. It then melted down to around 100 basis points by the end of 2022. Looking at the last ten years, this buffer may seem small, but not compared to the decades before the financial crisis. Between 1991 and 2007, it averaged only about 20 basis points. Against this background, we interpret the high difference between real estate yields and the risk-free interest rate, which developed after the financial crisis, as a historical anomaly. In our view, it is mainly explained by the ultra-loose monetary policy of the European Central Bank and in particular its active intervention in the bond markets. At the latest from 2015, when the ECB began extensive government bond purchases, the Bund yield was kept artificially low. The difference to initial property yields was distorted as a result. With the normalisation of monetary policy that has now begun, this situation should dissolve and the rise in real estate yields should be flatter than that of the risk-free interest rate. As a look at the early 1990s shows, prime real estate yields can even be below bond yields. Such a constellation presupposes high rental growth expectations."

By mid-2022, for the same rental yield, the increase in building costs and rise in interest rates would each call for a net rent of almost EUR 14.00 per m2, in other words an increase of around 30 per cent. A hike in rent of this magnitude within the space of one year would already be impossible. However, the combination of both factors would in fact call for a net rent of close to EUR 17 per m2, which would equate to a rent rise of around 60 per cent in just one year. What is the outlook for building new rental flats? Rents would have to rise sharply to cover construction costs and higher interest rates 45 The impact on building projects is illustrated by a survey of members carried out by the GdW. Around two thirds of members are planning to shelve new build renovation projects for the time being. Around one quarter are planning to give up new building projects altogether. Around 13 per cent intend to abstain from renovation projects. Bearing in mind the time it takes to complete building projects, the number of flat completions could fall noticeably from 2024 onwards, thus compounding the short- age of available flats."

These conversions are often much easier to envision than to execute, however, often requiring specialized expertise and substantial investment to execute. The value loss that owners We have too much retail space and too many office buildings, and not enough residential units or modern industrial space. That is the inescapable conclusion from our many discussions with leaders across the industry, as summarized in the preced- ing pages. There also is not enough developable land on which to build all the housing and warehouses where needed. Hmmm, maybe theres something to that. The Importance of Older Buildings In her classic 1961 urban planning treatise, The Death and Life of Great American Cities, Jane Jacobs elucidates the critical ingredients for a diverse, vibrant city. Among them is one rule that may seem puzzling at first: The district must mingle build- ings that vary in age and condition, including a good proportion of old ones. Why the need for old buildings? Why not all new? If a city area has only new buildings, the enterprises that can exist there are automatically limited to those that can support the high costs of new construction. How boring and monotonous that would be. Jacobs points to all the small local businesses that occupy these older structures that give the neighborhood its diversity and vitality."

The Asia Pacific office sector has traditionally accounted for a significant allocation in most Asia Pacific investors real estate portfolios , and that is expected to continue. A share of liquidity reduction for office assets in the region can be attributed to unfavorable views towards office assets in investors home countries, particularly the US. The reduction in logistics transaction volumes has been primarily driven by high prices and lack of product for sale, as the occupier market outlook remains healthy in most markets.

This is driving up borrowing costs and putting downward pressure on asset values. As of the time of writing, there were tentative signs that inflation may have peaked but many uncertainties remain.  The prospects for the depth and duration of the economic downturn vary substantially across the globe, with Europe in the worst position. That said, in most key markets globally the balance of real estate supply and demand remains relatively benign, somewhat moderating the sizable drag on total returns from rising capitalization rates that exists in many markets."

We are reluctant to make investment decisions based solely on a view of future interest rates, but acknowledge that real estate pricing is linked to future interest rates. Given this dynamic, we recommend investors consider a range of interest rate scenarios . Interest rate increases and the relentless math Each time interest rates ticked higher since the GFC, the question of when higher debt costs would impact real estate values was asked. It was a speculative question, with the underlying assumption that rate increases thus far had not yet impacted values. Regardless of the answer then, it became very clear in 2022 that the relentless math of higher borrowing rates was having an impact on leveraged returns and asset values . The boost investors were getting from borrowing has shifted to a drag on a cash basis, but with unleveraged internal rates of return generally above borrowing rates, leverage is still marginally accretive on a total return basis. However, with less lift from borrowing, leveraged buyers are largely out of the market . Higher borrowing rates are a function of both higher indices and increased borrowing spreads. Lending volume is down significantly and lenders are becoming more conservative. The supply of debt capital from large money center banks is down due to large positions taken in the first half of 2022 coupled with stress testing."

The industry may have good arguments against such policies, but that does not mean that governments wont introduce them anyway.

As the partner in one lead- ing advisory firm explains, This is one of those cash is king situations where borrowing costs are higher, and if youre an all- cash buyer, those probably represent a disproportionate share of the people in the market today. Meanwhile, the same interest rate increases that reduce lever- aged returns and thus demand for real estate also make bonds and other interest-bearing investments more compelling. As the head of real estate banking at one investment bank explains, Rising bond yields are going to mean that real estate and other alternatives are all going to be facing less availability of capital and some outflows. And while interest rates are increasing, equity and bond prices have been falling, triggering the denominator effect for some institutional investors with asset allocations that must remain in balance. The denominator effect can be magnified because CRE values in a portfolio are generally appraisal-based, which tend to be backward-looking. However, the impact on CRE portfolios may not be severe this time."

But the volume and range of these pro- posals show just how widespread the concerns are, and some of these initiatives could be revived if rents do not cool soon. In addition, many cities are considering enacting their own rent laws. In November 2021, voters in St. Paul, Minnesota, passed what some call the strictest rent control in the United States, limiting annual rent increases to 3 percent with no adjustment 27 for inflation, no exemption for new properties, no allowances for capital expenditures, and no vacancy decontrol for move-outs.

Existing rents could also show a higher dynamic in future than in the past. For example, the difference between new leases and existing rents widened in the boom, which could increase the pressure. In addition, rents for index-linked leases rose automatically due to high inflation. Their share of all leases is likely to be small, but due to the bottlenecks analysed below, landlords are likely to be able to enforce them increasingly. Politicians are discussing capping index-linked rents. However, this discussion has only recently flared up, and there is no agreement on this in the coalition agreement. According to consumer price statistics, existing rents in March 2023 were already up 2.0 on the previous year, the highest figure since 1998 . In addition, the share of short-term rentals and furnished apartments that are not regulated by rent brakes and caps is increasing, which means that rents can rise more strongly. We therefore believe it is likely that existing rents could rise strongly on a sustained basis, at least if inflation remains structurally high. 2."

In sum, the early 1990s laid the foundation for the maturation of the asset class. Five pillars provided support: 1. Capital market integration as securitized sources diversified the supply and demand for real estate capital. 2. Risk-return expansion to broaden the range of investment styles available. 3. Yield compression, a three-decade journey that reduced the cost of capital for real estate. 4. Rising transparency as data on fundamentals, pricing and capital flows became ubiquitous. And 5.

This is a difficult question to answer given the many risk factors. Trends triggered by the Covid pandemic, such as working from home (WFH), and the boom in online shopping, continue to have an impact. Added to these are the economic impact and uncertainty following Russias invasion of Ukraine. The real estate sector is facing a skills shortage, supply chain problems and rapidly rising costs for new construction and renovation. Rising capital market yields are driving up property financing costs and the returns expected by real estate investors. The ECB also contribu- ted to this with two strong key interest rate increases in July and September 2022.  This is not making decisions to invest in the real estate market any easier, alt- hough with initial rental yields clearly outperforming bond yields, property remains an interesting class.

Recession will likely be focused on the US and Europe, while growth in APAC slows but remains in positive territory. Global inflation should peak in 4Q22, while interest rates could top out in 1H23. Thereafter, we see potential for rate cuts in 2H23 as the narratives shift to reinvigorating growth. Against that backdrop, we expect volatility to stay elevated. More attractive deals could emerge, and investors should stay nimble. We think a slight geographical overweight on APAC would be beneficial for portfolios. Page 6 of 8 That said, we are not bullish, mainly because valuations in this part of the world have yet to adjust meaningfully. Cap rates have only expanded less than 50bps so far compared to up to 100bps in the US and Europe. We expect more rises to come in APAC though the growth buffer should mitigate them. We think the best strategy for real estate investors is broad diversification, both across countries and the different real estate sectors. We think the logistics and residential sectors with positive fundamentals, will continue to outperform, but only by a small margin."

The employment level remains high and unemployment increases only slightly. However, in our assessment, the downside risks outweigh the upside risks in this scenario, not least with a view to the winter of 202324, when another gas shortage could loom. The inflation forecast is also subject to this uncertainty because it is predominantly driven by energy prices. We assume here that the inflation momentum will already slow down significantly next year and that the European Central Banks inflation target of 2 will at least come into sight again in 2024. This goes hand in hand with the fact that the interest rate peak has almost been reached and the prime rate will be around 2 in the medium term. Here too, in our view, a less favourable course is much more likely than a more favourable development path. For example, it is conceivable that the deglobalisation tendencies that can be observed as well as the decarbonisation of the economy that has begun will ensure that inflation remains above the target level for a longer period of time. Either way, Germany is not a winner of the crisis this time."

Cost Escalations amid Supply Chain Challenges and Labor Shortages On top of concerns about the capital markets are supply chain shortages and delays as well as significant increases in costs for labor and materials.

Consumers  half of households use gas for heating  are will also have to adjust to high advance pay- ments and additional bills. From October a gas levy of an additional 2.4 cents per kWh will have to be paid. However, other heat sources such as oil, wood and electri- city have also become more expensive. Below the line, higher costs for food and particularly energy are imposing a burden on virtually every household. Nor is there any sign of the situation changing any time soon. Many households fear that they will be unable to afford the high additional bills. Even the clear increase in pensions in 2022 and relief measures such as the fuel discount, the lump sum energy price allowance of EUR 300, and the 9 Euro ticket are merely a drop in the ocean and also apply for only a limited period. It remains to be seen whe- ther, given the high risk of recession, the hitherto robust labour market and the shor- tage of skilled workers will lead to significant wage settlements."

According to CoStar, transaction volume for full- service assets in the first half of 2022 increased 7 percent from the same period in 2021, compared with a 1 percent decrease in limited-service deal volume. If business travel continues to recover, the focus on full-service assets in historically successful metro markets is expected to increase, since these investments often offer more value-add levers for a buyer to pull. Individual asset deals have also proved more favorable than portfolio deals. This trend is likely to continue as recovery time- lines across individual markets remain uneven. Improvement in RevPAR is driving down delinquency rates, which, in turn, has decreased instances of distressed sales. 69 70 Markets to Watch Theres always a new bull market somewhere. Youve just got to go find it.

For lenders, the need to refinance at higher rates and the opportunity to take floating- rate positions at newly raised levels make returns in debt strategies attractive in this environment. While there are opportunities for equity funds with dry powder, for funds currently invested, a series of adverse revaluations is likely. Index values declined in the third quarter, but valuation yields remain above tradeable market capitalization rates. However, the current widened bid-ask spread should give way to a normalization of capital markets from new rebased values, likely in the second half of 2023. As central banks become increasingly concerned about economic fundamentals, hiking cycles will also come to an end . Surprises in this area may already be over, with equilibrium policy rates having probably already been priced into swap markets. Policy rates still must get to these stabilized levels, but further upward shocks in rates now seem unlikely, with the possibility for some positive surprises and relief rallies if equilibrium rates end lower than expectations. However, a return to the yield levels of 2021 for European property seems inconceivable, so investor business plans must take the new reality of higher capitalization rates into account.

But with climate risks climbing still further, this year we highlight climates impact on us as owners, managers, and users of real propertyand how our industry can proactively address the impacts of climate change on our assets. Hotter, More Expensive Summers Several themes stand out. First, climate change may alter the dynamics of where we want to live. The hottest metro areas may soon face declining demandand potentially an exodus due to unbearable weather, even as households continue to migrate from colder climates to warmer metro areas overall. Large swathes of Texas and the U. S. Southwest have endured 100-degree highs almost every day this summer, with nighttime temperatures frequently not dipping below 80 degrees. And its not confined to just the Southwest. Heat domes have settled over the Pacific Northwest during the past two summers, bring- ing heatwaves unprecedented in their length and intensity. The built environment intensifies climate change as buildings and roads absorb and retain heat. This heat island effect raises not only daytime peaks but especially nighttime tempera- tures, which can be hazardous to humans if they cannot cool down at night."

An ever increasing number of people worldwide al- so have access to medical care. Life Sciences essentially consist of a combination of various scientific disciplines such as biology, chemistry, medicine and pharmaceuticals. In turn, the main activity of the biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and medical technology segments in focus he- re is research into living organisms. Life Sciences are associated with the develop- ment of economically successful products for human health rather than with funda- mental research. In Germany, biotechnology moved centre stage and gained additi- onal momentum with the approval of the first Covid vaccine. However, the path to producing a market-ready substance is long and fraught with obstacles. Only a fraction of the substances researched are actually successful. To achieve rapid progress, sufficiently large teams are needed. Growth in the number of jobs in Life Sciences is leading to correspondingly higher demand for properties and investment. According to estimates, more than 300,000 people in more than 2,000 companies are employed in the Life Sciences sector in Germany. Biotechnology is the smallest segment, while pharmaceuticals and medical technology employ signifi- cantly more people. The functions of the properties required range from pure offices via laboratories and pharmaceutical logistics to production plants. From our perspec- tive, this combination of office and laboratory  the lab office  is of particular interest to investors."

With an industry pen- etration rate of roughly 11 percent of U. S. households, the penetration rate does not need to increase dramatically for occupancy to rise to pre-pandemic levels. Looking ahead, many reasons exist to be optimistic about the outlook for senior housing, but the path forward may be a bit bumpy due to the prevailing winds in the broader economy. Inventory will continue to expand, although at a reduced pace in the near term, which should act as a tailwind for occupancy improvement. And, while demand may also be affected by economic headwinds, the value proposition of senior housingsecurity, socialization, engagement, room and board, care coordination, and lifestyleremains in place and ultimately should win the day by attracting new residents to senior housing properties.

Transportation Infrastructure We noted in a prior trend that many hypergrowth markets have been unable to keep up with building critical infrastructure, particularly that which is related to transportation. The infrastruc- ture funding bill will provide almost $600 billion in transportation funding. More than half of that will be allocated to the highway system, the largest such investment since the Interstate Highway System began construction in the 1950s.

Bouwinvest Outlook 2023-2025 24 Asia Pacific Residential Many of the fundamental demand drivers for residential real estate in Europe and the U.

By 2030, the region will account for 66 of the global middle-class population compared with 30 in 2009. This increase will accelerate the existing trend of urbanization, which means that population and economic growth will be higher in large cities, including the surrounding metropolitan areas, compared with national averages. This could lead to interesting residential real estate opportunities. In some markets such as Australia, Hong Kong and China, sales volumes and prices are falling in the owner-occupier residential market due to rising mortgage rates.

Analyses of ESG-related key performance indicators along- side their returns can now disabuse people of the notion that purpose-driven investing must equate with conces- sionary returns. Research now suggests that a companys improvement on material industry-specific ESG measures is predictive of significant future financial outperformance rela- tive to its competitive set. Continued next page. 29 Furthermore, big data and social media also are helping shed light on strategies that may contribute to more equi- table outcomes. For real estate investors, there now is a better understanding of the characteristics of places that are correlated with higher rates of upward mobility. Among the most notable, Harvard Think Tank Opportunity Insights has used anonymized census data, tax records, and most recently Facebook data to analyze the characteristics of high opportunity neighborhoods. They found a direct link between economic connectedness and higher levels of socioeconomic mobility for lower-income individuals. It is important to highlight that the research found that simple coexistence did not correlate with mobility. The correlation was with true connectedness across socioeconomic class lines. The built environment can fundamentally support or, conversely, limit that sense of connectedness."
index_300t_chunks:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!275,100,Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf," There has been increased recognition that supply is the crux of the challenge, and governments at all levels have announced efforts to address that. We have seen initiatives from higher levels of government to encourage faster development approvals by municipalities, new money to incentivize construction of affordable homes, and policy changes aimed at facilitating the building of modestly denser forms of housing, like duplexes, triplexes, and mid-rise buildings, in urban areas currently reserved for single-family units. While the increased acknowledgment of the supply gap is posi- tive and the initiatives in response are welcome, the actions fall have been taking on their own, with one describing efforts to make a small number of units more accessible by modifying deposit structures. One interviewee discussed their efforts to increase efficiencies by shifting certain engineering and construction activities to happen earlier in the design pro- cess. Another interviewee emphasized the need for more collaborative partnerships among industry players, nonprofit organizations, and governments to deliver affordable hous- ing. There are many examples of creative partnerships and approaches to building affordable homes in Canada that, with the right funding and incentives from governments, can make a difference if applied more broadly. Labor Shortages Amplifying the Affordability Challenge The other key issue is that even with better, more consistent, and more collaborative programs and policies focused on supply, labor shortages will impede significant progress on building more housing."

Initial rents in already expensive top locations continued to in- crease in the first half of 2022, albeit no longer quite so rapidly. The halt in de- mographic growth, together with stronger housebuilding activity, have dampe- ned growth in already high rents.  However, the supply and demand ratio could now deteriorate further. Massive price increases for new construction and significantly higher financing costs are applying the brakes to housebuilding. Conversely, based on population num- bers, cities are growing again. The main contributory factor here in 2022 has been the large number of refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine.  This suggests that rents will increase. However, it is doubtful whether this will actually happen."

But there is still considerable difference of opinion: a jump balleverybodys just guessing, says one investor. Whatever the ultimate figure, there is little doubt that a meaningful portion of todays office stock will be rendered redundant and available to be redevelopeda topic we discuss in the Finding a Higher Purpose trend. Also uncertain is how to design the space to best facilitate the kinds of collaborative work expected to dominate office work in the future, which likely will vary across firms and industries and take years to define. Another critical challenge is accommodat- ing worker preferences for individual workspaces if most people come into the office on the same three days to be with their col- leagues. Flex space might be the answer for many companies as they try to figure out their space needs. So far, the impacts on office markets have been relatively muted during this prolonged discovery period. Firms have held onto their offices either as a precaution in case they need the space in the future or because they could not break their lease. Thus, the level of physical office occupancy is considerably less than standard economic occupancy metrics as firms figure out what to do."

New developments could also change our calculations in the future. In particular, the publication of the data from the 2022 census could influence our estimates. It will be interesting to see to what extent there will be another sharp correction in the population figures or the housing stock as in 2011. In particular, there could be corrections due to the high number of refugees. In the past the relocation and departure of these residents often took place without official deregistration. 3.3 In most D cities, the supply shortage has been eliminated The fundamental supply shortage aggregated across our 126 cities ends in 2027 according to our new projection, but there are large regional differences, especially between large and small cities. A cumulative supply surplus in the A cities would persist until 2030, in the B cities until 2029 and in the C cities until 2026. In the 83 D cities, according to our methodology, there is already no longer a housing shortage in aggregate in recent years, but the surplus falls from almost 100,000 in 2021 to less than 40,000 in 2024.

The infrastructure law also provides funding to homeowners for energy efficiency upgrades through the Department of Energys weatherization assistance program. Though none of these programs offers direct assistance to own- ers of commercial real estate, there is plenty of motivation for the CRE sector to act on its own, given the enormous potential impacts of unchecked climate change. But it can be a hard, slow sell to convince owners and asset managers to undertake even cost-effective physical improvements that would protect their buildings, admits the principal in a CRE investment firm specializing in improving building resilience. Because extreme weather events occur so infrequently in any one location, the odds are low that anything will happen on your watch, especially if youre managing or holding the asset for only a few years. Thus, asset managers, who typically rotate every few years, often prefer to protect their buildings through insurance rather than upgrading them to withstand the extreme weather better but likely would be more expensive in the short term. That calculus could change if insurance costs are allowed to rise to reflect the full risks of climate change. In many high-risk areas, insurance is subsidized, or insurers are limited in what 25 they can charge, creating a moral hazard that encourages owners to locate in risky regions and not undertake sensible physical improvements. I would prefer that they bear the price of that amenity and location fully, and they dont, says one academic."

Employees increasingly want to know how their work contributes to company goals. Reverse-mentoring initiatives are a good way to incorporate the opinions of more junior members alongside senior leaders. Firms should provide opportunities for career development and upskilling by supplementing daily responsibilities with projects outside of employees normal scopes.  Foster inclusivity with those who work remotely. Take steps to ensure everyone has equal opportunities to form connections, especially so that those who spend less time in the office dont feel punished. Strategies include intentional in-person meetings, hybrid working team training sessions, equitable promotion rates for remote workers, and encouraging manager one-on-ones.68 23 Embracing technology for greater efficiency and new opportunities SOME SURVEY RESPONDENTS foresee a reduction in technology budgets in the near term, given overall economic concerns, including inflation, labor costs, and ongoing supply chain uncertainties.

COVID was particularly hard on the senior housing sector. Many investors had reduced their appreciation expectations for senior housing as the impact of the coronavirus weighed heavily on their view of the sector. According to NCREIF Property Index (NPI) investment return data, short-term total returns for senior housing were low at 1.08 percent in the first quarter of 2022 compared with the broader NPI, which saw total returns of 5.33 percent in the first quarter. Appreciation returns for the NPI dwarf those of senior housing, since the NPI was boosted in part by outsized returns in industrial prop- erties . The senior housing income return in the first quarter was 0.91 percent, its best showing since late 2020. This was stronger than industrial and nearly on par with apartments, and slightly less than the NPI .

As this publication goes to press in late September 2022, it is too soon to know whether this time will prove more successful than similar prior deadlines that passed with little apparent impact. But will workers return? As the senior leader of a development company said, Everyones still in a fact-finding mode. The contours of the decision are by now familiar: employer demands for control and building culture, the need for mentoring and col- laboration, and workers fear of missing out will translate into more in-office work over time. But those factors will be weighed against the potential to save on occupancy costs and especially worker demands for more locational flexibility. As we continue to hear, Theres just been a shift in consumer behavior. Most people dont want to commute into the office five days a week, in the words of one senior investment adviser. For now, tight labor markets ensure that employees have the upper hand in these negotiations and will resist employer desires to have workers return to the office. But that could change if unemployment rises in a downturn. Says the head of real estate at one investment bank, I dont think well know the outcome of office until were through a recession and the power dynamics between employee and employer change.

This would include reporting on greenhouse gas emissions and the portfolios carbon footprint, as well as the climate risks an owner or investor may have in their real estate portfolio. Not all investors are covered, but as with the NCREIFPREA reporting principles, the SEC regulations could have broader impact given the market size of the entities that are specifically covered. The proposed changes would apply to registered investment advisers, advisers exempt from registration, reg- istered investment companies, and business development companies. These would include REITs, with additional report- ing requirements for funds specializing in ESG investing, such as green building funds. Indeed, the SEC and European Union regulators are already launching investigations into companies accused of misrepresenting their environmental impacts in funds claimed to be green.

Earnings have been unusually robust during the two years since COVID- 19 hit, driven by strong property fundamentals and intense investor demandas well as ultra-cheap debt and the federal governments three rounds of stimulus spending. Total returns for the institutional-quality real estate in the NCREIF Property Index (NPI) soared to over 20 percent in the four quarters through mid-2022, almost three times the 20-year average. But returns will be coming down. The 43 economists and ana- lysts surveyed in October 2022 by ULIs Center for Real Estate Economics and Capital Markets expect total returns to drop to 3.8 percent in 2023, and recover to a moderate 7 percent in 2024. That is to say, more normal returns. That outlook tracks with the collective wisdom of respondents to this years Emerging Trends survey. More than half believe that capitalization rates are heading up next year and returns are coming down, primarily due to rising interest rates and cost of capital, which was the top economic concern voiced in our survey. After more than a decade of lower for longer, the Fed is finally normalizing interest rates closer to historical levels. Those rising interest rates are already driving up debt costs and thus the costs to acquire and develop property, reducing leveraged returns. At the same time, the federal government is done with providing stimulus, indirectly reducing tenant demand for space."

That solved the issue for many early movers, but prices and rents have been rising much faster in many of these Zoom towns, reducing their affordability, a topic we take up in our trend Rewardsand Growing Painsin the Sun Belt. So far, migra- tion from the highest-priced markets has not been enough to actually reduce housing costs in those markets, though costs generally are rising more slowly there. Demographics and the slowing economy could also help ease the housing imbalance. The nations population is growing at its slowest pace ever, thanks to both low birth and immigration rates. And fewer buyers are on the hunt for homes now due to affordability and concerns about possible job losses in a recession. The good news is that it is an opportunity for home- builders and land developers to do a little catch-up. Theyve been running behind for two years, and they may actually welcome a little respite to finish the homes that they have sold, thinks a senior adviser to many homebuilders. But these favorable trends alone will not be nearly enough to solve the affordability quandary. What else would help?

Properly managed, this can result in fewer resident hospitalizations, reduce federal and state-level health care spending, and act as a catalyst for future business opportunities and collaborations. Further, thoughtful care intervention can provide support to the overall health care ecosystem through the support and creation of conscientious awareness and follow-through. And, once senior housing is fully recognized as part of the health care continuum, senior housing operators will be able to participate in the revenue streams asso- ciated with a capitated risk-sharing model of care. Tailwinds for occupancy recovery. Two tailwinds support an ongoing occupancy recovery for senior housing. First, on the supply side, the number of senior housing units under construction in the second quarter of 2022 for the 31 NIC MAP Primary Markets was the fewest since 2015."

Furthermore, a rising share of CRE investors is not gov- erned by fixed asset allocations, including public REITs, private investment firms, and high-net-worth individuals, and especially nontraded REITs, which have grown to be among the leading investors in CRE, with an asset value of almost $300 billion in 2021. In sum, capital availability should decline in the near term, though the denominator effect may not force sales as much as in typical downturns. Uncertainty Hesitancy Perhaps the biggest headwind to getting deals done now is uncertainty over where prices will settle. Reflecting the views of many experts we interviewed, one senior investment banker says, Transactions are being done at cap rates that are anywhere from 25 to 75 basis points wider than they werebut there is not any conviction that these are the right levels. That translates into a 5 to 15 percent drop in values so far, with more to come. But there are too few assets trading now to know for sure. Buyers are concerned about overpaying. Says one banker: Now is not the time to be a heromeaning, its not the time to go out and be aggressive on buying something. Its not the time to be aggressive on borrowing."

B and C value-add investments suit a growing market of younger and mid-career households stuck in the limbo of scarce supply, high prices, and high interest mortgages that will delay their becoming homeowners. Closing a gaping, and widening, chasm in new investment and development would well serve households in the 80 to 120 percent range of area median household income levels the wage range of many essential workers such as teachers, sanitation workers, law enforcement officers, and fire and medical first responders. Furthermore, addressing this missing middle household income level does not preclude the need for additions to and preservation of properties for lower-income households. The Great Bottleneck: Local Ballot Boxes Apartment stakeholders number-one nemesis, blocking private- sector market solutions to deep and growing mismatches between demand and supply, is a many-headed hydraa bevy of deep-rooted restrictive land use, permitting, and regulatory cost burdens that thwart higher-density multifamily develop- ment. On top of these longstanding challenges, a growing push for rent regulation is adding uncertainty to the market. For example, while 26 states prohibit local municipalities from implementing rent control laws, five states permit localities to enforce rent controlNew York, New Jersey, California, Oregon, and Marylandas well as Washington, D.
