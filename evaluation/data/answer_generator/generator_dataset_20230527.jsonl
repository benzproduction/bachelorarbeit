Finally, high permitting fees and utility charges and large minimum lot sizes push developers to build more expensive homes. Renters Priced Out of the Homebuying Market With a growing share of households priced out of the for-sale market, demand for rental units is far outstripping new supply. Though population growth slowed sharply during the pandemic, demand is also rising from the many young adults eager to start their own households after moving back in with their parents during COVID. Further boosting demand is the increasing number of younger adults choosing to live alone, according The multifamily sector has responded with an unprecedented increase in new supply. Weve built more multifamily housing units over the last 10 years than we had in any other time since 1980, notes an adviser to institutional investors. But it is still far less than needed. Vacancies have fallen to their lowest levels ever while rents are rising faster than evereven faster than home prices. And though not a formal part of the affordability calculations, other housing-related costs like utilities and main- tenance are also rising faster than incomes, further constraining the ability of households to afford basic shelter.

New building activity did not start to pick up until 2012 onwards, long after the surge in immigration after the turn of the century. On an aggregated basis across top locations, only around 20,000 homes p. a. were built from 2002 to 2011. Thereafter, completion figures rose to over 50,000 units up until 2018. Rising purchase prices, rental growth and higher investor demand made new builds lucrative. Between 2016 and 2019, building permits for 60,000 flats and more were issued every year, which means that even higher numbers of units could have been built. Instead, however, housing construction has been slowing down again since 2019  falling to around 40,000 units by 2021. Building in towns and cities was hampered by the fact that the construction industry was working more or less at capacity, by a shortage of skilled workers and of materials, along with the emergence of protests here and there. Now though, the construction industry faces much stronger head- wind, and consequently, completion figures are likely to decline further. A shortage of materials is being compounded by a rapid rise in construction costs  above all a huge rise in the price of building materials  along with higher financing costs.

In addition, we analyze how opportunistic and value-add managers will need to adopt their strategies now that interest rates are higher, and how their ability to generate out-size returns simply by adding leverage is gone. So, a number of important topics for us and investors to consider. We hope you find our answers insightful and useful in determining your strategy and thinking about some of the key questions in real estate as we move into the new year. Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy. Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs. We have already started to see cap rates and yields rise in many markets, with the most rapid adjustment taking place in the UK. However, we do not think that prices fully reflect higher interest rates yet. To assess when values might bottom out, we can look to past downturns and the listed market for guidance. In the Global Financial Crisis, for example, global capital values bottomed out in 4Q09, while GDP across global real estate markets troughed three quarters earlier, in 1Q09, as did global listed real estate prices1. Market downturns usually present opportunities, and one we expect for investors in 2023 is a correction in pricing as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. Although we do not expect large amounts of distress in the market, we do expect some, already apparent in parts of the UK market. This should allow investors access to assets at attractive pricing. The early 1990s downturn was longer, with US capital values continuing to decline into 1995. We expect modest declines in GDP in the first half of 2023 before growth resumes.", "filename": "global-real-estate-markets-2023.pdf", "page": 2, "Cluster": 3}]}, "ideal": {"answer": "Yes"}}

LOOKING AHEAD  The relentless math of higher interest rates will continue to weigh heavily on real estate values, at least until interest rates stabilize as inflation begins to subside. The bid- ask spread for private real estate should eventually close and transactions will resume in earnest at a rebased level.  In the meantime, investment styles that are less sensitive to volatility in values should be contemplated, such as floating-rate lending with a comfortable cushion from lower loan-to-value ratios. Debt investment can be attractive at times of uncertainty, as investors tilt toward contractually certain income and away from an uncertain upside.

Given the current macro environment, we believe that investor expectations of rental growth are not sufficiently high for this in any sector. The logistics market and the less regulated part of the residential market might be an exception. But here, too, the uncertainty about further developments is likely to be too great, at least temporarily. Another relevant lower edge for property yields is financing costs. At the end of the third quarter of 2022, prime yields in all major market segments were below the cost of debt capital . This situation could only persist if the number of equity buyers is sufficiently large. Indeed, such investors are currently quite active and are taking advantage of the lower prices for purchases. However, we think it unlikely that the existing equity volume will be sufficient to anchor prices below the cost of financing. The fact that the increase in initial yields is nevertheless likely to be comparatively flat is also due to the mostly comfortable financing situation on the part of the landlords. Apart from the project development segment, we expect few forced sales. We rule out a wave of non-performing loans like after the financial crisis. Nevertheless, the steep rise in interest rates is likely to put individual landlords under stress, especially in the value-add and opportunistic segments, where financing durations are typically short.

Office values will fall more than other property sectors such as multifamily in which rising rents counterbalance higher cap rates. Plus, debt is becoming more constrained as lenders and bond investors are wary of the potential for increased risk of default if office tenants downsize. There is uncertainty in the cost and access to debt finance for office, noted one executive. The Emerging Trends survey confirmed that industry partici- pants are conflicted about pricing, favoring niche sectors such as medical office, and expecting that suburban offices will retain value better than center city offices. Conversions to Rise, but . . As tenants eschew older, lower-quality stock, that means that more office buildings are candidates for conversion. Obsolete 62 office buildings around the country are being converted to multifamily, industrial, medical offices, life sciences, and other uses. States such as New York and New Jersey are exploring legislation to ease the entitlement process around conversions. It makes perfect sense in Manhattan, where the office vacancy rate has shot up in Midtown as tenants chase new buildings in Hudson Yards and housing is in critically short supply. For example, New York developers Silverstein Properties and Macklowe Properties are converting office towers to apartments, and Hines is converting a tower in Salt Lake City. Even so, conversions remain sporadic relative to the new constructionnearly 150 million square feet of office space is under construction nationally, per Yardi Matrixdue to logistics. Conversions are costly and the stars need to be aligned with the right building configuration, floor plates, neighborhood ameni- ties, and demand, not to mention considerations such as tax structure. Each conversion stands on its own. Notes Moodys Analytics: The office-to-apartment conversion trend will likely be a minor one, unless office values and rents see some major, permanent decline after the pandemic. Finding an obsolete office building at the right price and asking rents, with high vacancy and the right floor plates to convert into an apartment building is great in theory, but hard to execute in todays market.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf", "page": 66, "Cluster": 71}]}, "ideal": {"answer": "Property values dropped 10 to 20 percent"}}

They should come back to more of a long-term historical average of 3 percent to 4 percent, and maybe offset some of the unafford- ability in the country.

According to a recent Bloomberg report, After dipping in 2020, the number of new units authorized in multifamily build- ings took off, running 37 percent higher over the past 12 months as of June 2022 than in the same period in 20182019. As of August, 862,000 apartments were under construction, up 25 percent from a year ago. At the same time, COVIDs aftermath sharply defined conflicting forceswhich together destine virtually all of Americas newly developed and built apartment communities for a financially privileged professional class. Rather than causing an expansion of rental housing stock, however, higher-income households come-lately demand for rental neighborhoods instead served to crowd out moderate- and lower-income households in supply- constrained areas.

S. domes- tic migration and mobility continues at over 27 million movers each year. Financial factorsgiven that runaway costs and high mortgage interest rates will price more households out of homeownership as an optionwill determine many of their decisions, as has long been the case.
