Higher interest rates are less of a concern in Japan where the spread between the risk-free rate and real estate yields remains stable.

Within the region, and for the first time in decades, it is expected that Australia and Singapore will record higher quarterly GDP growth figures in Q3 and Q4 2022 than China.

Australia is cementing its status as a safe haven in the region. Singapores relative attractiveness to Hong Kong is expec- ted to increase. Higher interest rates are less of a concern in Japan where the spread between the risk-free rate and real estate yields remains stable. A zero-Covid-19 policy, a troubled property sector and geopolitical tensions have led to a risk premium for China. Asia Pacific Macro-economic trends The Asia-Pacific region is expected to grow faster during 2023- 2025 compared with the U. S. or EU with a lower risk of recession. Within the region, and for the first time in decades, it is expected that Australia and Singapore will record higher quarterly GDP growth figures in Q3 and Q4 2022 than China.

After more than a decade of lower for longer, the Fed is finally normalizing interest rates closer to historical levels. Those rising interest rates are already driving up debt costs and thus the costs to acquire and develop property, reducing leveraged returns. At the same time, the federal government is done with providing stimulus, indirectly reducing tenant demand for space. Unlike in the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and during the pandemic, nobodys coming to the rescue, and now we got to take our medicine, and here it comes, says the head of research for an investment management firm. Thus, the government is turning off both the monetary and fiscal spigots that had been support- ing commercial real estate and the economy overall. The head of a development company summarized it like this: I feel like weve been on a little bit of a sugar high with this stimu- lus and cheap debt. Theres going to be a slowdown. Theres got to be this normalization. So, what does that mean? I think its going to be a little bouncy. Its going to be a little bit turbulent. But then we bottom out, and we start back into growth. 2.  Still, Weve Changed Some  The pandemic forced structural shifts in how and where we live, work, and recreate in ways that seem destinated to endure.  Online spending is receding from its pandemic peaks but is not likely to revert to pre-pandemic levels.

S. commercial property markets actually embarked on a remarkable run, with some of the strongest returns, rent growth, and price appreciation rates ever recorded. Not every property type, however: hotels endured their worst and most sustained downturn in memory, while offices suffered an unprecedented and significant cut in usage of space. And not every market: some of the nations strongest gateway mar- kets, like New York City and San Francisco, experienced sharp outflows of residents, businesses, and tenants of all types. But overall and across much of the United States, property markets far outperformed expectations and historical norms. And now, more than two years on, property investors and managers are learning anew that whopping growth and profits eventually fall back to eartha reversion to the mean, to use finance jargon, or simply normalizing, as numerous industry experts we interviewed put it. Some looming market adjustments will be cyclical due to the weakening economic conditions that most economists and real estate professionals expect, while others represent more of a return to normalcy after all the pandemic-fueled market distortions. These market reversions will take several forms: prices of most assets are declining as cap rates rise and transaction volumes fall from record levels, while rent gains for others are merely moderating as demand returns to more sustainable levels. Perhaps the biggest surprise is that these reversals of fortune are hitting favored property sectors like multifamily and indus- trial. That does not necessarily mean the market corrections will be painful. In many cases, recent losses in property value will only trim already healthy gains. But many indicators suggest that the (really) good times may be over, at least for a while. Housing Set to Cool A finance executive with one national homebuilder told us, Were still selling. Its just not at the pace that it was selling before the last two years, which was a pace that you dont typi- cally see. So, the markets are more normalizing.; real_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!13:  More than half believe that capitalization rates are heading up next year and returns are coming down, primarily due to rising interest rates and cost of capital, which was the top economic concern voiced in our survey. After more than a decade of lower for longer, the Fed is finally normalizing interest rates closer to historical levels. Those rising interest rates are already driving up debt costs and thus the costs to acquire and develop property, reducing leveraged returns. At the same time, the federal government is done with providing stimulus, indirectly reducing tenant demand for space. Unlike in the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and during the pandemic, nobodys coming to the rescue, and now we got to take our medicine, and here it comes, says the head of research for an investment management firm. Thus, the government is turning off both the monetary and fiscal spigots that had been support- ing commercial real estate and the economy overall. The head of a development company summarized it like this: I feel like weve been on a little bit of a sugar high with this stimu- lus and cheap debt. Theres going to be a slowdown. Theres got to be this normalization. So, what does that mean? I think its going to be a little bouncy. Its going to be a little bit turbulent. But then we bottom out, and we start back into growth. 2.  Still, Weve Changed Some  The pandemic forced structural shifts in how and where we live, work, and recreate in ways that seem destinated to endure.  Online spending is receding from its pandemic peaks but is not likely to revert to pre-pandemic levels. Business travel is unlikely to recover to pre-COVID levels for at least several years, meaning business hotels, fine dining, and conference facilities will continue to face challenges.  The greatest changes may be in how and where we work. The impact on office use and leasing is still evolving, and a significant share of the existing stock may need to be reposi- tioned to remain competitive.;\n***\n[Submission]: \n\nYes, both sources concur that there is a reversion to the norm occurring within the markets.

Were going to build 10 new units, and as they sell, well start the next one, etc. And then labor shortages are compounding the problems. The construction sector as a whole hasnt returned to the peak we saw prior to the Great Recession. We saw a lot of that labor leave the sector for something maybe perceived more stable, says the economist for a housing advisory firm. All these factors are conspiring to limit housing construction far below population growth. In fact, the number of single-family housing starts in the last decade (20102019) relative to house- hold formations was the lowest since the government began tracking these trends and half as much or less than in preced- ing decades, despite the consistent increase in deliveries since bottoming in 2010. And now both permits and housing starts have been trending down again in 2022.

Three, constrained construction of new supply, and a price run-up on the single-family for-sale front, spilled over into expanded apartment demand.  Lastly, compounding the effects of these four dramatic imbalances came the rocket fuel of a global capital rotation toward de-risked assets . Outsized demand, a sudden spike in remote work mobility, constricted supply, and floods of money with nowhere better to goa grand slam of anomalies. The U. S. apartment property sectorproviding shelter to 37 mil- lion residents in 21.3 million structures of five or more household units, and contributing $3.4 trillion annually to the U. S. economy, according to the NMHCmorphed quickly into an investment asset class pressure cooker. Inflated property valuations, com- pressed cap rates, and a sea change from individual owners to medium and large-sized corporate owners became a new norm seemingly overnight. This time period veers wildly from a steady slope of otherwise well-entrenched trends across the structural demand front. Operational modernization kicked into super-fast-forward mode toward self-service, and a robust new-development pipeline at least. According to a recent Bloomberg report, After dipping in 2020, the number of new units authorized in multifamily build- ings took off, running 37 percent higher over the past 12 months as of June 2022 than in the same period in 20182019. As of August, 862,000 apartments were under construction, up 25 percent from a year ago. At the same time, COVIDs aftermath sharply defined conflicting forceswhich together destine virtually all of Americas newly developed and built apartment communities for a financially privileged professional class. Rather than causing an expansion of rental housing stock, however, higher-income households come-lately demand for rental neighborhoods instead served to crowd out moderate- and lower-income households in supply- constrained areas. Its been virtually impossible to build affordable, says the chief executive of one of the apartment industry trade groups.;\n***\n[Submission]: \n\nNo, the existing regulations related to individual property taxation are not driving the present trend towards bigger homes. The primary drivers of the trend are increased demand for larger living spaces to balance remote work and household life, constrained construction of new supply, and a sudden spike in remote work mobility, compounded by floods of money with nowhere better to go [real_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!68].\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

Note: Based on U. S. respondents only. Says the regional leader of one global firm, Cap rates have gapped out as interest rates went up. And suddenly, things didnt pencil, and that generated broken deals. The cost of financing for real estate and everything else went up dramatically. And so everything has to be repriced, everything has to be reset. Also limiting investor demand: debt is getting more difficult to obtain, and the Emerging Trends survey expects underwriting standards to get even more rigorous. As the partner in one lead- ing advisory firm explains, This is one of those cash is king situations where borrowing costs are higher, and if youre an all- cash buyer, those probably represent a disproportionate share of the people in the market today. Meanwhile, the same interest rate increases that reduce lever- aged returns and thus demand for real estate also make bonds and other interest-bearing investments more compelling. As the head of real estate banking at one investment bank explains, Rising bond yields are going to mean that real estate and other alternatives are all going to be facing less availability of capital and some outflows.;", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf", "page": 13, "Cluster": 75}, {"key": "real_estate_index:outlook-real-estatet-market-germany-dec-2022.pdf-!10", "text": "real_estate_index:outlook-real-estatet-market-germany-dec-2022.pdf-!10:  With the normalisation of monetary policy that has now begun, this situation should dissolve and the rise in real estate yields should be flatter than that of the risk-free interest rate. As a look at the early 1990s shows, prime real estate yields can even be below bond yields. Such a constellation presupposes high rental growth expectations. Given the current macro environment, we believe that investor expectations of rental growth are not sufficiently high for this in any sector. The logistics market and the less regulated part of the residential market might be an exception. But here, too, the uncertainty about further developments is likely to be too great, at least temporarily. Another relevant lower edge for property yields is financing costs. At the end of the third quarter of 2022, prime yields in all major market segments were below the cost of debt capital . This situation could only persist if the number of equity buyers is sufficiently large. Indeed, such investors are currently quite active and are taking advantage of the lower prices for purchases. However, we think it unlikely that the existing equity volume will be sufficient to anchor prices below the cost of financing. The fact that the increase in initial yields is nevertheless likely to be comparatively flat is also due to the mostly comfortable financing situation on the part of the landlords.

Note: Based on U. S. respondents only. Says the regional leader of one global firm, Cap rates have gapped out as interest rates went up. And suddenly, things didnt pencil, and that generated broken deals. The cost of financing for real estate and everything else went up dramatically. And so everything has to be repriced, everything has to be reset. Also limiting investor demand: debt is getting more difficult to obtain, and the Emerging Trends survey expects underwriting standards to get even more rigorous. As the partner in one lead- ing advisory firm explains, This is one of those cash is king situations where borrowing costs are higher, and if youre an all- cash buyer, those probably represent a disproportionate share of the people in the market today. Meanwhile, the same interest rate increases that reduce lever- aged returns and thus demand for real estate also make bonds and other interest-bearing investments more compelling. As the head of real estate banking at one investment bank explains, Rising bond yields are going to mean that real estate and other alternatives are all going to be facing less availability of capital and some outflows.; real_estate_index:outlook-real-estatet-market-germany-dec-2022.pdf-!10:  With the normalisation of monetary policy that has now begun, this situation should dissolve and the rise in real estate yields should be flatter than that of the risk-free interest rate. As a look at the early 1990s shows, prime real estate yields can even be below bond yields. Such a constellation presupposes high rental growth expectations. Given the current macro environment, we believe that investor expectations of rental growth are not sufficiently high for this in any sector. The logistics market and the less regulated part of the residential market might be an exception. But here, too, the uncertainty about further developments is likely to be too great, at least temporarily. Another relevant lower edge for property yields is financing costs. At the end of the third quarter of 2022, prime yields in all major market segments were below the cost of debt capital . This situation could only persist if the number of equity buyers is sufficiently large. Indeed, such investors are currently quite active and are taking advantage of the lower prices for purchases. However, we think it unlikely that the existing equity volume will be sufficient to anchor prices below the cost of financing. The fact that the increase in initial yields is nevertheless likely to be comparatively flat is also due to the mostly comfortable financing situation on the part of the landlords. Apart from the project development segment, we expect few forced sales. We rule out a wave of non-performing loans like after the financial crisis. Nevertheless, the steep rise in interest rates is likely to put individual landlords under stress, especially in the value-add and opportunistic segments, where financing durations are typically short. Lower demand for space and rents due to the recession could jeopardise the implementation of the business plan and thus also refinancing.;\n***\n[Submission]: \n\nYes, due to the escalating borrowing expenses and prime yields being beneath the cost of debt capital, purchasers paying in cash came to the fore in the market towards the end of 2022, as evidenced by the fact that prime yields in all major market segments were below the cost of debt capital at the end of the third quarter of 2022 [real_estate_index:outlook-real-estatet-market-germany-dec-2022.pdf-!10].

Plans for the City of Frankfurt to play an active role in the development of the city centre - some of which is not very attractive - are also positive. A total of EUR 30m is to be invested in city centre projects, with the aim of upgrading the quality of stay. How- ever, retail is also playing a role here. For example, the Galeria store at the entrance to the Zeil has been remodelled into the Weltstadthaus and has been visibly upgraded while remaining open. The former sports arena building which is also close to the Hauptwache is being demolished and will be replaced by 2024 by a modern commercial building with offices.

Moving to More Affordable Recent slowdowns in rent growth and home price appreciation, noted in our Normalizing trend, have done little to increase affordability. So how to address this? Millions of people have taken matters into their own hands.;\n***\n[Submission]: \n\nYes, complications in the building industry, such as a lack of trained manpower and building resources, have obstructed construction activities. According to [Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!27], the construction industry is working more or less at capacity, with a shortage of skilled workers and of materials, along with the emergence of protests here and there. Additionally, the cost of new build flats has increased by a good 3 per cent p. a. and the cost of renovation has risen on a similar scale. This has resulted in a decline in completion figures and a growing share of households priced out of the for-sale market.\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

The Covid-led dip in take-up has been largely ironed out by a bounce-back in de- mand for office space since the end of 2021. Take-up in Q2 2022 rose to over 1 mil- lion m2  a figure only exceeded seven times in the 50 quarters since 2010. The ear- lier uptick in vacancies has been brought to a halt by an increase in letting activity. Overall, the vacancy rate rose by 1.5 percentage points to around 4.5 per cent on the back of the pandemic, but as such remains fairly low. Whereas there was a more pronounced variation in the vacancy rate between the seven top locations in the past, two camps have now emerged. At 8 per cent, the vacancy rate in Dsseldorf and Frankfurt is roughly twice that of the five other loca- tions which have figures of 3 to 4 per cent. Prior to Covid, Berlin, Munich and Stuttgart had the lowest vacancy rates. Most recently, though, they have been beat- en by Cologne with a figure of 2.8 per cent.;\n***\n[Submission]: \n\nYes, the vacancy rate in Cologne is 2.8%, according to [real_estate_index].\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

Further boosting demand is the increasing number of younger adults choosing to live alone, according The multifamily sector has responded with an unprecedented increase in new supply.

Renters Priced Out of the Homebuying Market With a growing share of households priced out of the for-sale market, demand for rental units is far outstripping new supply. Though population growth slowed sharply during the pandemic, demand is also rising from the many young adults eager to start their own households after moving back in with their parents during COVID. Further boosting demand is the increasing number of younger adults choosing to live alone, according The multifamily sector has responded with an unprecedented increase in new supply. Weve built more multifamily housing units over the last 10 years than we had in any other time since 1980, notes an adviser to institutional investors. But it is still far less than needed. Vacancies have fallen to their lowest levels ever while rents are rising faster than evereven faster than home prices. And though not a formal part of the affordability calculations, other housing-related costs like utilities and main- tenance are also rising faster than incomes, further constraining the ability of households to afford basic shelter. Moving to More Affordable Recent slowdowns in rent growth and home price appreciation, noted in our Normalizing trend, have done little to increase affordability. So how to address this? Millions of people have taken matters into their own hands.;\n***\n[Submission]: \n\nYes, difficulties in the construction industry, like a shortage of skilled workers and materials, have hampered building efforts. According to [Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!27], building costs shot up due to supply chain disruptions and are still worrisome, high permitting fees and utility charges and large minimum lot sizes push developers to build more expensive homes, and a shortage of materials is being compounded by a rapid rise in construction costs. Additionally, [2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!72] states that new building has failed to keep up a high pace, and housing construction has been slowing down again since 2019, falling to around 40,000 units by 2021.\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

New building activity did not start to pick up until 2012 onwards, long after the surge in immigration after the turn of the century. On an aggregated basis across top locations, only around 20,000 homes p. a. were built from 2002 to 2011. Thereafter, completion figures rose to over 50,000 units up until 2018. Rising purchase prices, rental growth and higher investor demand made new builds lucrative. Between 2016 and 2019, building permits for 60,000 flats and more were issued every year, which means that even higher numbers of units could have been built. Instead, however, housing construction has been slowing down again since 2019  falling to around 40,000 units by 2021. Building in towns and cities was hampered by the fact that the construction industry was working more or less at capacity, by a shortage of skilled workers and of materials, along with the emergence of protests here and there. Now though, the construction industry faces much stronger head- wind, and consequently, completion figures are likely to decline further. A shortage of materials is being compounded by a rapid rise in construction costs  above all a huge rise in the price of building materials  along with higher financing costs. A 30- year average shows that the cost of new build flats has increased by a good 3 per cent p. a. The increase in costs in 2018 and 2019 was considerably higher, but since 2021, it has been unprecedented: Construction costs rose by around 9 per cent in 2021 and, in the first half of 2022, they rose by almost 16 per cent!

As one housing industry adviser notes, Theres a stress index about global supply chains, and those stress indices are all indicating that theyre moderating, but theyre still at very high levels. Finally, high permitting fees and utility charges and large minimum lot sizes push developers to build more expensive homes. Renters Priced Out of the Homebuying Market With a growing share of households priced out of the for-sale market, demand for rental units is far outstripping new supply. Though population growth slowed sharply during the pandemic, demand is also rising from the many young adults eager to start their own households after moving back in with their parents during COVID. Further boosting demand is the increasing number of younger adults choosing to live alone, according The multifamily sector has responded with an unprecedented increase in new supply. Weve built more multifamily housing units over the last 10 years than we had in any other time since 1980, notes an adviser to institutional investors. But it is still far less than needed. Vacancies have fallen to their lowest levels ever while rents are rising faster than evereven faster than home prices. And though not a formal part of the affordability calculations, other housing-related costs like utilities and main- tenance are also rising faster than incomes, further constraining the ability of households to afford basic shelter.

New building activity did not start to pick up until 2012 onwards, long after the surge in immigration after the turn of the century. On an aggregated basis across top locations, only around 20,000 homes p. a. were built from 2002 to 2011. Thereafter, completion figures rose to over 50,000 units up until 2018. Rising purchase prices, rental growth and higher investor demand made new builds lucrative. Between 2016 and 2019, building permits for 60,000 flats and more were issued every year, which means that even higher numbers of units could have been built. Instead, however, housing construction has been slowing down again since 2019  falling to around 40,000 units by 2021. Building in towns and cities was hampered by the fact that the construction industry was working more or less at capacity, by a shortage of skilled workers and of materials, along with the emergence of protests here and there. Now though, the construction industry faces much stronger head- wind, and consequently, completion figures are likely to decline further. A shortage of materials is being compounded by a rapid rise in construction costs  above all a huge rise in the price of building materials  along with higher financing costs. A 30- year average shows that the cost of new build flats has increased by a good 3 per cent p. a. The increase in costs in 2018 and 2019 was considerably higher, but since 2021, it has been unprecedented: Construction costs rose by around 9 per cent in 2021 and, in the first half of 2022, they rose by almost 16 per cent! The cost of reno- vation has risen on a similar scale.; real_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!27: 1 Changes to building codes over the past 10 years Sources: National Association of Home Builders. National Multifamily Housing Council. confidence suggests that that decline will likely continue until the interest rate environment turns more favorable. to a report from economists at the Fed, perhaps a reaction to lockdown claustrophobia. And the homes that do get built are expensive, particularly since the pandemic. Construction costs shot up due to supply chain disruptions and are still worrisome. As one housing industry adviser notes, Theres a stress index about global supply chains, and those stress indices are all indicating that theyre moderating, but theyre still at very high levels. Finally, high permitting fees and utility charges and large minimum lot sizes push developers to build more expensive homes. Renters Priced Out of the Homebuying Market With a growing share of households priced out of the for-sale market, demand for rental units is far outstripping new supply. Though population growth slowed sharply during the pandemic, demand is also rising from the many young adults eager to start their own households after moving back in with their parents during COVID. Further boosting demand is the increasing number of younger adults choosing to live alone, according The multifamily sector has responded with an unprecedented increase in new supply. Weve built more multifamily housing units over the last 10 years than we had in any other time since 1980, notes an adviser to institutional investors. But it is still far less than needed. Vacancies have fallen to their lowest levels ever while rents are rising faster than evereven faster than home prices. And though not a formal part of the affordability calculations, other housing-related costs like utilities and main- tenance are also rising faster than incomes, further constraining the ability of households to afford basic shelter. Moving to More Affordable Recent slowdowns in rent growth and home price appreciation, noted in our Normalizing trend, have done little to increase affordability. So how to address this?

So, a number of important topics for us and investors to consider. We hope you find our answers insightful and useful in determining your strategy and thinking about some of the key questions in real estate as we move into the new year. Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy. Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs. We have already started to see cap rates and yields rise in many markets, with the most rapid adjustment taking place in the UK. However, we do not think that prices fully reflect higher interest rates yet. To assess when values might bottom out, we can look to past downturns and the listed market for guidance. In the Global Financial Crisis, for example, global capital values bottomed out in 4Q09, while GDP across global real estate markets troughed three quarters earlier, in 1Q09, as did global listed real estate prices1. Market downturns usually present opportunities, and one we expect for investors in 2023 is a correction in pricing as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. Although we do not expect large amounts of distress in the market, we do expect some, already apparent in parts of the UK market. This should allow investors access to assets at attractive pricing. The early 1990s downturn was longer, with US capital values continuing to decline into 1995.

Australia is cementing its status as a safe haven in the region. Singapores relative attractiveness to Hong Kong is expec- ted to increase. Higher interest rates are less of a concern in Japan where the spread between the risk-free rate and real estate yields remains stable. A zero-Covid-19 policy, a troubled property sector and geopolitical tensions have led to a risk premium for China. Asia Pacific Macro-economic trends The Asia-Pacific region is expected to grow faster during 2023- 2025 compared with the U. S. or EU with a lower risk of recession.

Perhaps the biggest surprise is that these reversals of fortune are hitting favored property sectors like multifamily and indus- trial.

In addition, we analyze how opportunistic and value-add managers will need to adopt their strategies now that interest rates are higher, and how their ability to generate out-size returns simply by adding leverage is gone. So, a number of important topics for us and investors to consider. We hope you find our answers insightful and useful in determining your strategy and thinking about some of the key questions in real estate as we move into the new year. Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy. Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs. We have already started to see cap rates and yields rise in many markets, with the most rapid adjustment taking place in the UK. However, we do not think that prices fully reflect higher interest rates yet. To assess when values might bottom out, we can look to past downturns and the listed market for guidance. In the Global Financial Crisis, for example, global capital values bottomed out in 4Q09, while GDP across global real estate markets troughed three quarters earlier, in 1Q09, as did global listed real estate prices1. Market downturns usually present opportunities, and one we expect for investors in 2023 is a correction in pricing as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. Although we do not expect large amounts of distress in the market, we do expect some, already apparent in parts of the UK market. This should allow investors access to assets at attractive pricing. The early 1990s downturn was longer, with US capital values continuing to decline into 1995. We expect modest declines in GDP in the first half of 2023 before growth resumes.;", "filename": "global-real-estate-markets-2023.pdf", "page": 2, "Cluster": 3}], "completion": "\n\nYes, capitalization rates and yields are escalating across various markets, including the UK, without full consideration of higher interest rates [real_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!9; real_estate_index:global-real-estate-markets-2023.pdf-!1].", "ideal": "Yes"}, "created_by": null, "created_at": "2023-06-09 09:58:59.469027+00:00", "category": "DIFFERENT_WORDING_MULTIPLE_PARAGRAPHS"}

Some looming market adjustments will be cyclical due to the weakening economic conditions that most economists and real estate professionals expect, while others represent more of a return to normalcy after all the pandemic-fueled market distortions. These market reversions will take several forms: prices of most assets are declining as cap rates rise and transaction volumes fall from record levels, while rent gains for others are merely moderating as demand returns to more sustainable levels. Perhaps the biggest surprise is that these reversals of fortune are hitting favored property sectors like multifamily and indus- trial. That does not necessarily mean the market corrections will be painful. In many cases, recent losses in property value will only trim already healthy gains. But many indicators suggest that the (really) good times may be over, at least for a while. Housing Set to Cool A finance executive with one national homebuilder told us, Were still selling. Its just not at the pace that it was selling before the last two years, which was a pace that you dont typi- cally see. So, the markets are more normalizing.; real_estate_index:global-real-estate-markets-2023.pdf-!1:  We also dive into student housing in the US, another sector booming among investors, and what impact demographic trends might have on it. In addition, we analyze how opportunistic and value-add managers will need to adopt their strategies now that interest rates are higher, and how their ability to generate out-size returns simply by adding leverage is gone. So, a number of important topics for us and investors to consider. We hope you find our answers insightful and useful in determining your strategy and thinking about some of the key questions in real estate as we move into the new year. Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy. Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs. We have already started to see cap rates and yields rise in many markets, with the most rapid adjustment taking place in the UK. However, we do not think that prices fully reflect higher interest rates yet. To assess when values might bottom out, we can look to past downturns and the listed market for guidance. In the Global Financial Crisis, for example, global capital values bottomed out in 4Q09, while GDP across global real estate markets troughed three quarters earlier, in 1Q09, as did global listed real estate prices1. Market downturns usually present opportunities, and one we expect for investors in 2023 is a correction in pricing as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. Although we do not expect large amounts of distress in the market, we do expect some, already apparent in parts of the UK market. This should allow investors access to assets at attractive pricing. The early 1990s downturn was longer, with US capital values continuing to decline into 1995. We expect modest declines in GDP in the first half of 2023 before growth resumes.;\n***\n[Submission]: \n\nYes, capitalization rates and yields are escalating across various markets, including the UK, without full consideration of higher interest rates [real_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!9; real_estate_index:global-real-estate-markets-2023.pdf-!1].\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

Not every property type, however: hotels endured their worst and most sustained downturn in memory, while offices suffered an unprecedented and significant cut in usage of space. And not every market: some of the nations strongest gateway mar- kets, like New York City and San Francisco, experienced sharp outflows of residents, businesses, and tenants of all types. But overall and across much of the United States, property markets far outperformed expectations and historical norms.

Take-up in Q2 2022 rose to over 1 mil- lion m2  a figure only exceeded seven times in the 50 quarters since 2010. The ear- lier uptick in vacancies has been brought to a halt by an increase in letting activity. Overall, the vacancy rate rose by 1.5 percentage points to around 4.5 per cent on the back of the pandemic, but as such remains fairly low. Whereas there was a more pronounced variation in the vacancy rate between the seven top locations in the past, two camps have now emerged. At 8 per cent, the vacancy rate in Dsseldorf and Frankfurt is roughly twice that of the five other loca- tions which have figures of 3 to 4 per cent. Prior to Covid, Berlin, Munich and Stuttgart had the lowest vacancy rates. Most recently, though, they have been beat- en by Cologne with a figure of 2.8 per cent.;\n***\n[Submission]: \n\nAnswer: Yes, take-up in Q2 2022 rose to over 1 million m2 [real_estate_index].\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

Australia is cementing its status as a safe haven in the region. Singapores relative attractiveness to Hong Kong is expec- ted to increase. Higher interest rates are less of a concern in Japan where the spread between the risk-free rate and real estate yields remains stable. A zero-Covid-19 policy, a troubled property sector and geopolitical tensions have led to a risk premium for China. Asia Pacific Macro-economic trends The Asia-Pacific region is expected to grow faster during 2023- 2025 compared with the U. S. or EU with a lower risk of recession. Within the region, and for the first time in decades, it is expected that Australia and Singapore will record higher quarterly GDP growth figures in Q3 and Q4 2022 than China. During the outlook period, China is expected to recover and follow its growth path but at a slower pace . Bouwinvest Outlook 2023-2025 21 Asia Pacific GDP Growth Asia Pacific Source: Oxford Economics, baseline scenario 2022 Q4 2023 Q4 2024 Q4 2025 Q4 Australia China Japan Singapore Hong Kong China usually props up its economy with direct measures such as infrastructure spending or fiscal support rather than adjustments to its interest rates. The one-year prime loan rate is currently 3.65. Rising inflation and higher interest rates are a concern for all Asia-Pacific markets, with the exception of China and Japan. Japan is keeping a lid on interest rate growth and its benchmark 10-year government bond rate remains close to zero. The spread between property yields and the risk-free rate is therefore intact. However, the Bank of Japans persistently low interest rate policy means that the exchange rate of the yen against the USD is now at a 50-year low.; real_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!37:  2 0 2 v o N 1 2 0 2 v o N 2 2 0 2 v o N 2012 Office 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 YTD 2022 Industrial Retail Multi-family rental Hotel Others Note: Australias interest rate refers to the Bank Bill Swap Rate (BBSW), Chinas interest rate refers to the Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate , Hong Kongs interest rate refers to the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR), Japans interest rate refers to the Tokyo Overnight Average Rate (TONA), Singapores interest rate refers to the Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA), South Koreas interest rate refers to the Certificate of Deposit (CDC).

S. commercial property markets actually embarked on a remarkable run, with some of the strongest returns, rent growth, and price appreciation rates ever recorded. Not every property type, however: hotels endured their worst and most sustained downturn in memory, while offices suffered an unprecedented and significant cut in usage of space. And not every market: some of the nations strongest gateway mar- kets, like New York City and San Francisco, experienced sharp outflows of residents, businesses, and tenants of all types. But overall and across much of the United States, property markets far outperformed expectations and historical norms. And now, more than two years on, property investors and managers are learning anew that whopping growth and profits eventually fall back to eartha reversion to the mean, to use finance jargon, or simply normalizing, as numerous industry experts we interviewed put it. Some looming market adjustments will be cyclical due to the weakening economic conditions that most economists and real estate professionals expect, while others represent more of a return to normalcy after all the pandemic-fueled market distortions. These market reversions will take several forms: prices of most assets are declining as cap rates rise and transaction volumes fall from record levels, while rent gains for others are merely moderating as demand returns to more sustainable levels. Perhaps the biggest surprise is that these reversals of fortune are hitting favored property sectors like multifamily and indus- trial. That does not necessarily mean the market corrections will be painful. In many cases, recent losses in property value will only trim already healthy gains. But many indicators suggest that the (really) good times may be over, at least for a while. Housing Set to Cool A finance executive with one national homebuilder told us, Were still selling.

After more than a decade of lower for longer, the Fed is finally normalizing interest rates closer to historical levels. Those rising interest rates are already driving up debt costs and thus the costs to acquire and develop property, reducing leveraged returns. At the same time, the federal government is done with providing stimulus, indirectly reducing tenant demand for space. Unlike in the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and during the pandemic, nobodys coming to the rescue, and now we got to take our medicine, and here it comes, says the head of research for an investment management firm. Thus, the government is turning off both the monetary and fiscal spigots that had been support- ing commercial real estate and the economy overall. The head of a development company summarized it like this: I feel like weve been on a little bit of a sugar high with this stimu- lus and cheap debt. Theres going to be a slowdown. Theres got to be this normalization. So, what does that mean? I think its going to be a little bouncy. Its going to be a little bit turbulent.

Still, Weve Changed Some  The pandemic forced structural shifts in how and where we live, work, and recreate in ways that seem destinated to endure.  Online spending is receding from its pandemic peaks but is not likely to revert to pre-pandemic levels. Business travel is unlikely to recover to pre-COVID levels for at least several years, meaning business hotels, fine dining, and conference facilities will continue to face challenges.

Here is the data:\n[BEGIN DATA]\n***\n[Question]: Can we link the escalating capitalization rates and dwindling returns to heightened interest rates and the escalating cost of capital, as discerned in the American real estate market?\n***\n[Ideal Answer]: Yes\n***\n[Context]: real_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!9:  Defying just about every prediction voiced during the terrifying and uncertain days of the COVID lockdown that began in March 2020, U. S. commercial property markets actually embarked on a remarkable run, with some of the strongest returns, rent growth, and price appreciation rates ever recorded. Not every property type, however: hotels endured their worst and most sustained downturn in memory, while offices suffered an unprecedented and significant cut in usage of space. And not every market: some of the nations strongest gateway mar- kets, like New York City and San Francisco, experienced sharp outflows of residents, businesses, and tenants of all types. But overall and across much of the United States, property markets far outperformed expectations and historical norms. And now, more than two years on, property investors and managers are learning anew that whopping growth and profits eventually fall back to eartha reversion to the mean, to use finance jargon, or simply normalizing, as numerous industry experts we interviewed put it. Some looming market adjustments will be cyclical due to the weakening economic conditions that most economists and real estate professionals expect, while others represent more of a return to normalcy after all the pandemic-fueled market distortions. These market reversions will take several forms: prices of most assets are declining as cap rates rise and transaction volumes fall from record levels, while rent gains for others are merely moderating as demand returns to more sustainable levels. Perhaps the biggest surprise is that these reversals of fortune are hitting favored property sectors like multifamily and indus- trial. That does not necessarily mean the market corrections will be painful. In many cases, recent losses in property value will only trim already healthy gains. But many indicators suggest that the (really) good times may be over, at least for a while. Housing Set to Cool A finance executive with one national homebuilder told us, Were still selling. Its just not at the pace that it was selling before the last two years, which was a pace that you dont typi- cally see. So, the markets are more normalizing.; real_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!13:  More than half believe that capitalization rates are heading up next year and returns are coming down, primarily due to rising interest rates and cost of capital, which was the top economic concern voiced in our survey. After more than a decade of lower for longer, the Fed is finally normalizing interest rates closer to historical levels. Those rising interest rates are already driving up debt costs and thus the costs to acquire and develop property, reducing leveraged returns. At the same time, the federal government is done with providing stimulus, indirectly reducing tenant demand for space. Unlike in the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and during the pandemic, nobodys coming to the rescue, and now we got to take our medicine, and here it comes, says the head of research for an investment management firm. Thus, the government is turning off both the monetary and fiscal spigots that had been support- ing commercial real estate and the economy overall. The head of a development company summarized it like this: I feel like weve been on a little bit of a sugar high with this stimu- lus and cheap debt. Theres going to be a slowdown. Theres got to be this normalization. So, what does that mean? I think its going to be a little bouncy. Its going to be a little bit turbulent. But then we bottom out, and we start back into growth. 2.  Still, Weve Changed Some  The pandemic forced structural shifts in how and where we live, work, and recreate in ways that seem destinated to endure.  Online spending is receding from its pandemic peaks but is not likely to revert to pre-pandemic levels. Business travel is unlikely to recover to pre-COVID levels for at least several years, meaning business hotels, fine dining, and conference facilities will continue to face challenges.  The greatest changes may be in how and where we work. The impact on office use and leasing is still evolving, and a significant share of the existing stock may need to be reposi- tioned to remain competitive.;\n***\n[Submission]: \n\nYes, we can link the escalating capitalization rates and dwindling returns to heightened interest rates and the escalating cost of capital, as discerned in the American real estate market. According to [real_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!9] and [real_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!13], rising interest rates are driving up debt costs and thus the costs to acquire and develop property, reducing leveraged returns.

Many of the changes were relatively minor, and nine of the 10 highest-rated markets last year repeated this year . But there were some material changes over the year as about a quarter of markets moved up or down in rankings by at least 10 places. And consistent with our normal- izing trend, many of the markets near the top of the standings last year have fallen this year, while many previously lower- rate markets have risen: More than half (11) of the 20-highest rated markets in last years survey fell in the rankings this year, although almost all by less than 10 places.

Thirteen of the 20-lowest rated markets in last years survey rose in the rankings this year.

Compiled by Nelson Economics. Note: Bold type indicates the 20 highest-rated markets in Emerging Trends in Real Estate 2023 survey for overall real estate prospects. 73 Changes in Attitudes, Changes in Latitudes Befitting the changes in economic and market trends and outlooks that we have highlighted in this report, respondents to the Emerging Trends survey expressed substantial changes in market preferences. Many of the changes were relatively minor, and nine of the 10 highest-rated markets last year repeated this year . But there were some material changes over the year as about a quarter of markets moved up or down in rankings by at least 10 places. And consistent with our normal- izing trend, many of the markets near the top of the standings last year have fallen this year, while many previously lower- rate markets have risen: More than half (11) of the 20-highest rated markets in last years survey fell in the rankings this year, although almost all by less than 10 places. Meanwhile, some of the markets that were found lower in the rankings in prior years are now finding more support. Thirteen of the 20-lowest rated markets in last years survey rose in the rankings this year. Some Like It Hot Despite the modest drop in the Supernova ratings this year, Emerging Trends survey respondents still see the best prospects in Sun Belt metropolitan areas, which have been growing over time. The number of Sun Belt markets among the top 20 markets for overall prospects has increased from 10 in 2011 to 14 in each of the past two years. At the same time, the number of markets in cold-weather climates in the Northeast and Midwest has declined from five to just two . These climate preferences are even stronger at the top and bot- tom of the rankings.;\n***\n[Submission]: \n\nYes, 14 Sun Belt markets were among the top 20 markets for overall prospects in 2011 [Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!122].\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

G LO BA L In this ISA Outlook 2023, we look through the current acute period of volatility and uncertainty to discuss our view of likely outcomes and scenarios to consider, key themes for investing and real estate strategy recommendations that we expect to be resilient across the range of conceivable macro environments. Inflation should eventually settle closer to central banks target levels, allowing the longed-for pivot in interest rates. Bid-ask spreads in real estate capital markets will narrow, allowing activity to resume at an adjusted pricing level. The attraction of real estate as an asset class will endure, with variation around sectors, assets and geographies.

We have reached that milestone in most parts of the world. The virus is no longer a major constraint on life in many countries. While some things have not returned to the way they were pre- pandemic, that has been due to other factors, such as shifting preferences, not infection counts and restrictions. A year ago, key uncertainties surrounding our predictions for moving beyond the acute pandemic phase were around issues like new COVID variants and booster deployment. As for todays economic situation, key uncertainties include:  How long will it take for inflation to come under control? How high must interest rates go in the meantime? There have recently been signs that inflation is peaking, but such hopes could prove fleeting.;", "filename": "isa-outlook-2023.pdf", "page": 5, "Cluster": 75}, {"key": "real_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!16", "text": "real_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!16:  G LO BA L 2 The path of fundamentals will ultimately help determine where values settle Early in 2022, we framed the impact of rising inflation and interest rates on values as a race between debt costs and net operating income growth, as we anticipated that higher inflation would translate into higher rents in some sectors. Currently, it seems that debt costs are mostly winning the race. Ultimately, however, valuations are the result of the interaction between higher debt costs and the path of real estate fundamentals, the prospects for which vary widely across sectors and geographies. Tracing back real estate cash flows to their drivers is to follow a chain of causation back to basic variables like population, GDP, industrial production, consumer spending and employment. All of these interact with real estate factors, such as the balance of property supply and occupier demand, to influence property cash flows. Secular megatrends and structural features like legal and contractual constraints also matter. Going into 2023, there is increased uncertainty in many of these variables, especially the economic ones, given the pace of economic expansion is expected to be weaker or negative. This will have a cooling impact on property NOI growth, but nuances remain given that the transmission of macroeconomic conditions to real estate is a winding path. Starting with the underlying economic fundamentals, we are seeing a great deal of variation globally. In addition to the dimensions of depth and duration, a key uncertainty surrounding the coming downturn is how widespread it will be. Europe faces especially severe challenges stemming from an energy price shock, with ripple effects of unknown global scope. The dominant driver of inflation in the US, Canada and Singapore is that their economies are robust and operating close to full capacity. Demand- led inflation is relatively benign compared to inflation from a supply shock, but the central banks in these countries must still raise interest rates, either to manage their domestic economic situations or because their monetary policies are linked to the US Federal Reserve . Rising interest rates create clear risks to economic growth, with housing markets already being impacted by higher mortgage rates. Europes employment picture is also solid, but in addition to home-grown inflation, it is coping with a severe, energy-driven supply shock caused by the Russia-Ukraine war.;", "filename": "isa-outlook-2023.pdf", "page": 7, "Cluster": 75}], "completion": "\n\nYes, the current economic robustness in the US, Canada, and Singapore likely supports a pivot in interest rates, assuming inflation settles closer to the target levels of central banks.

We have identified five global themes that we think investors should keep in mind as we move through the acute phase of monetary tightening toward a more stable global economy. G LO BA L In this ISA Outlook 2023, we look through the current acute period of volatility and uncertainty to discuss our view of likely outcomes and scenarios to consider, key themes for investing and real estate strategy recommendations that we expect to be resilient across the range of conceivable macro environments. Inflation should eventually settle closer to central banks target levels, allowing the longed-for pivot in interest rates. Bid-ask spreads in real estate capital markets will narrow, allowing activity to resume at an adjusted pricing level. The attraction of real estate as an asset class will endure, with variation around sectors, assets and geographies. G.4 Long-term inflation expectations remain subdued Inflation-protected yields anticipating a deceleration of inflation Breakeven rate between nominal and inflation-protected risk-free rates 200 150 100 50 0 -50 -100 transition to a living with COVID period. We have reached that milestone in most parts of the world. The virus is no longer a major constraint on life in many countries. While some things have not returned to the way they were pre- pandemic, that has been due to other factors, such as shifting preferences, not infection counts and restrictions. A year ago, key uncertainties surrounding our predictions for moving beyond the acute pandemic phase were around issues like new COVID variants and booster deployment. As for todays economic situation, key uncertainties include:  How long will it take for inflation to come under control? How high must interest rates go in the meantime? There have recently been signs that inflation is peaking, but such hopes could prove fleeting.; real_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!16:  G LO BA L 2 The path of fundamentals will ultimately help determine where values settle Early in 2022, we framed the impact of rising inflation and interest rates on values as a race between debt costs and net operating income growth, as we anticipated that higher inflation would translate into higher rents in some sectors. Currently, it seems that debt costs are mostly winning the race. Ultimately, however, valuations are the result of the interaction between higher debt costs and the path of real estate fundamentals, the prospects for which vary widely across sectors and geographies. Tracing back real estate cash flows to their drivers is to follow a chain of causation back to basic variables like population, GDP, industrial production, consumer spending and employment. All of these interact with real estate factors, such as the balance of property supply and occupier demand, to influence property cash flows. Secular megatrends and structural features like legal and contractual constraints also matter. Going into 2023, there is increased uncertainty in many of these variables, especially the economic ones, given the pace of economic expansion is expected to be weaker or negative. This will have a cooling impact on property NOI growth, but nuances remain given that the transmission of macroeconomic conditions to real estate is a winding path. Starting with the underlying economic fundamentals, we are seeing a great deal of variation globally. In addition to the dimensions of depth and duration, a key uncertainty surrounding the coming downturn is how widespread it will be. Europe faces especially severe challenges stemming from an energy price shock, with ripple effects of unknown global scope. The dominant driver of inflation in the US, Canada and Singapore is that their economies are robust and operating close to full capacity. Demand- led inflation is relatively benign compared to inflation from a supply shock, but the central banks in these countries must still raise interest rates, either to manage their domestic economic situations or because their monetary policies are linked to the US Federal Reserve . Rising interest rates create clear risks to economic growth, with housing markets already being impacted by higher mortgage rates. Europes employment picture is also solid, but in addition to home-grown inflation, it is coping with a severe, energy-driven supply shock caused by the Russia-Ukraine war.;\n***\n[Submission]: \n\nYes, the current economic robustness in the US, Canada, and Singapore likely supports a pivot in interest rates, assuming inflation settles closer to the target levels of central banks.

Any changes to the yield control approach are likely to come after BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kurodas term concludes in April 2023. Nonetheless, most of the challenges Japan is facing are externally driven, while domestic-driven fundamentals remain relatively healthy. Australia, South Korea and Singapore are the most directly impacted by rising interest rates in the West. The outlook of these economies is likely to follow AP.1 Diverging monetary policies in Asia Pacific the trends in the West, albeit to varying degrees. The Monetary Authority of Singapore manages monetary policies through the foreign exchange markets, given that for a small and open economy, the exchange rate has a much stronger influence on inflation than the interest rate. That said, the magnitude of interest rate hikes in Singapore has been less than that of the US. Additionally, an increasing number of firms are pivoting to Singapore for their regional headquarters due to its geopolitical stability. All of these are adding to the relative strength of Singapores economy. The weakness of Asia Pacific currencies is mostly a story of US dollar strength. Nevertheless, uncertainties over the macro outlook and the dispersion among regional economies could lead to the continuing divergence of real estate market performance in the next 12-24 months. The diverse economic and real estate market trends within the region have the potential to contribute diversification benefits to institutional investors global portfolios.

Additionally, office values are expected to fall more than other property sectors such as multifamily due to rising cap rates, debt constraints, and tenant downsizing [Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!104]. Obsolete office buildings are being converted to multifamily, industrial, medical offices, life sciences, and other uses [Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!104]. However, conversions remain sporadic due to logistics and other considerations [Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!104].\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

Office values will fall more than other property sectors such as multifamily in which rising rents counterbalance higher cap rates. Plus, debt is becoming more constrained as lenders and bond investors are wary of the potential for increased risk of default if office tenants downsize. There is uncertainty in the cost and access to debt finance for office, noted one executive.

Obsolete 62 office buildings around the country are being converted to multifamily, industrial, medical offices, life sciences, and other uses. States such as New York and New Jersey are exploring legislation to ease the entitlement process around conversions. It makes perfect sense in Manhattan, where the office vacancy rate has shot up in Midtown as tenants chase new buildings in Hudson Yards and housing is in critically short supply.

Office values will fall more than other property sectors such as multifamily in which rising rents counterbalance higher cap rates. Plus, debt is becoming more constrained as lenders and bond investors are wary of the potential for increased risk of default if office tenants downsize. There is uncertainty in the cost and access to debt finance for office, noted one executive. The Emerging Trends survey confirmed that industry partici- pants are conflicted about pricing, favoring niche sectors such as medical office, and expecting that suburban offices will retain value better than center city offices. Conversions to Rise, but . . As tenants eschew older, lower-quality stock, that means that more office buildings are candidates for conversion. Obsolete 62 office buildings around the country are being converted to multifamily, industrial, medical offices, life sciences, and other uses. States such as New York and New Jersey are exploring legislation to ease the entitlement process around conversions. It makes perfect sense in Manhattan, where the office vacancy rate has shot up in Midtown as tenants chase new buildings in Hudson Yards and housing is in critically short supply. For example, New York developers Silverstein Properties and Macklowe Properties are converting office towers to apartments, and Hines is converting a tower in Salt Lake City. Even so, conversions remain sporadic relative to the new constructionnearly 150 million square feet of office space is under construction nationally, per Yardi Matrixdue to logistics.

Higher interest rates are less of a concern in Japan where the spread between the risk-free rate and real estate yields remains stable.

Asia Pacific Macro-economic trends The Asia-Pacific region is expected to grow faster during 2023- 2025 compared with the U. S. or EU with a lower risk of recession. Within the region, and for the first time in decades, it is expected that Australia and Singapore will record higher quarterly GDP growth figures in Q3 and Q4 2022 than China.

The one-year prime loan rate is currently 3.65. Rising inflation and higher interest rates are a concern for all Asia-Pacific markets, with the exception of China and Japan. Japan is keeping a lid on interest rate growth and its benchmark 10-year government bond rate remains close to zero. The spread between property yields and the risk-free rate is therefore intact.

In Japan, yield curve control comes at the cost of a weak yen. If the Bank of Japan (BoJ) remains committed to keeping interest rates near zero, currency intervention, such as yen-buying to prevent further depreciation, could be on the table again. However, currency intervention has rarely been successful absent the cooperation from other central banks. Any changes to the yield control approach are likely to come after BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kurodas term concludes in April 2023. Nonetheless, most of the challenges Japan is facing are externally driven, while domestic-driven fundamentals remain relatively healthy. Australia, South Korea and Singapore are the most directly impacted by rising interest rates in the West. The outlook of these economies is likely to follow AP.1 Diverging monetary policies in Asia Pacific the trends in the West, albeit to varying degrees. The Monetary Authority of Singapore manages monetary policies through the foreign exchange markets, given that for a small and open economy, the exchange rate has a much stronger influence on inflation than the interest rate. That said, the magnitude of interest rate hikes in Singapore has been less than that of the US. Additionally, an increasing number of firms are pivoting to Singapore for their regional headquarters due to its geopolitical stability. All of these are adding to the relative strength of Singapores economy. The weakness of Asia Pacific currencies is mostly a story of US dollar strength. Nevertheless, uncertainties over the macro outlook and the dispersion among regional economies could lead to the continuing divergence of real estate market performance in the next 12-24 months.

Australia is cementing its status as a safe haven in the region. Singapores relative attractiveness to Hong Kong is expec- ted to increase. Higher interest rates are less of a concern in Japan where the spread between the risk-free rate and real estate yields remains stable. A zero-Covid-19 policy, a troubled property sector and geopolitical tensions have led to a risk premium for China. Asia Pacific Macro-economic trends The Asia-Pacific region is expected to grow faster during 2023- 2025 compared with the U. S. or EU with a lower risk of recession. Within the region, and for the first time in decades, it is expected that Australia and Singapore will record higher quarterly GDP growth figures in Q3 and Q4 2022 than China. During the outlook period, China is expected to recover and follow its growth path but at a slower pace .

The one-year prime loan rate is currently 3.65. Rising inflation and higher interest rates are a concern for all Asia-Pacific markets, with the exception of China and Japan. Japan is keeping a lid on interest rate growth and its benchmark 10-year government bond rate remains close to zero. The spread between property yields and the risk-free rate is therefore intact. However, the Bank of Japans persistently low interest rate policy means that the exchange rate of the yen against the USD is now at a 50-year low.; real_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!34:  Economic growth in China in 2023 should be below historical averages, but strong enough to make it one of the fastest growing large economies. In Japan, yield curve control comes at the cost of a weak yen. If the Bank of Japan (BoJ) remains committed to keeping interest rates near zero, currency intervention, such as yen-buying to prevent further depreciation, could be on the table again. However, currency intervention has rarely been successful absent the cooperation from other central banks. Any changes to the yield control approach are likely to come after BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kurodas term concludes in April 2023. Nonetheless, most of the challenges Japan is facing are externally driven, while domestic-driven fundamentals remain relatively healthy. Australia, South Korea and Singapore are the most directly impacted by rising interest rates in the West. The outlook of these economies is likely to follow AP.1 Diverging monetary policies in Asia Pacific the trends in the West, albeit to varying degrees. The Monetary Authority of Singapore manages monetary policies through the foreign exchange markets, given that for a small and open economy, the exchange rate has a much stronger influence on inflation than the interest rate. That said, the magnitude of interest rate hikes in Singapore has been less than that of the US. Additionally, an increasing number of firms are pivoting to Singapore for their regional headquarters due to its geopolitical stability. All of these are adding to the relative strength of Singapores economy. The weakness of Asia Pacific currencies is mostly a story of US dollar strength. Nevertheless, uncertainties over the macro outlook and the dispersion among regional economies could lead to the continuing divergence of real estate market performance in the next 12-24 months. The diverse economic and real estate market trends within the region have the potential to contribute diversification benefits to institutional investors global portfolios.

Three, constrained construction of new supply, and a price run-up on the single-family for-sale front, spilled over into expanded apartment demand.  Lastly, compounding the effects of these four dramatic imbalances came the rocket fuel of a global capital rotation toward de-risked assets . Outsized demand, a sudden spike in remote work mobility, constricted supply, and floods of money with nowhere better to goa grand slam of anomalies. The U. S. apartment property sectorproviding shelter to 37 mil- lion residents in 21.3 million structures of five or more household units, and contributing $3.4 trillion annually to the U. S. economy, according to the NMHCmorphed quickly into an investment asset class pressure cooker. Inflated property valuations, com- pressed cap rates, and a sea change from individual owners to medium and large-sized corporate owners became a new norm seemingly overnight.

We have identified five global themes that we think investors should keep in mind as we move through the acute phase of monetary tightening toward a more stable global economy. G LO BA L In this ISA Outlook 2023, we look through the current acute period of volatility and uncertainty to discuss our view of likely outcomes and scenarios to consider, key themes for investing and real estate strategy recommendations that we expect to be resilient across the range of conceivable macro environments. Inflation should eventually settle closer to central banks target levels, allowing the longed-for pivot in interest rates. Bid-ask spreads in real estate capital markets will narrow, allowing activity to resume at an adjusted pricing level. The attraction of real estate as an asset class will endure, with variation around sectors, assets and geographies.

We have reached that milestone in most parts of the world. The virus is no longer a major constraint on life in many countries. While some things have not returned to the way they were pre- pandemic, that has been due to other factors, such as shifting preferences, not infection counts and restrictions. A year ago, key uncertainties surrounding our predictions for moving beyond the acute pandemic phase were around issues like new COVID variants and booster deployment. As for todays economic situation, key uncertainties include:  How long will it take for inflation to come under control? How high must interest rates go in the meantime? There have recently been signs that inflation is peaking, but such hopes could prove fleeting.;", "filename": "isa-outlook-2023.pdf", "page": 5, "Cluster": 75}, {"key": "real_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!15", "text": "real_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!15: 5 Spiking rates drive rapid tightening of financial conditions Cost of capital rising sharply in most geographies Nominal corporate bond yields 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 7 0 n a J 8 0 n a J 9 0 n a J 0 1 n a J 1 1 n a J 2 1 n a J 3 1 n a J 4 1 n a J 5 1 n a J 6 1 n a J 7 1 n a J 8 1 n a J 9 1 n a J 0 2 n a J 1 2 n a J 2 2 n a J US C. Europe Singapore Japan United Kingdom Australia Canada Source: Bloomberg. As of November 30, 2022. LOOKING AHEAD  The relentless math of higher interest rates will continue to weigh heavily on real estate values, at least until interest rates stabilize as inflation begins to subside. The bid- ask spread for private real estate should eventually close and transactions will resume in earnest at a rebased level.  In the meantime, investment styles that are less sensitive to volatility in values should be contemplated, such as floating-rate lending with a comfortable cushion from lower loan-to-value ratios. Debt investment can be attractive at times of uncertainty, as investors tilt toward contractually certain income and away from an uncertain upside. Portfolio aggregation strategies with smaller asset sizes that lend themselves to averaging-in with diversified timing of entry points represent another way to cope with volatile and uncertain values.  The inputs to the math are not changing to the same degree in every part of the world. Wherever rate spikes are less intense, or the prospects for rental growth are clearest, transaction activity and prices have been less impacted.  In addition to debt costs, investors should also consider the trajectory of cash flows, which depend on economic fundamentals and real estate occupier market conditions.

Explains one academic, Investors are allowed to not only deduct everything, but also they can depreciate the unit. They also have access to lower cost of capital. In sum, institutional buyers assembling horizontal apartment portfolios can afford to pay more to be the high bidder for homes. And they do. Investors account for one in five homebuyers, up by a third compared with before the pandemic. Another supply constraint is homebuilders cautious construc- tion pacing, a vestige of the last recession. Explains the director of an investment institute who developed housing earlier in his career, A lot of the homebuilders, when the Great Recession happened, were stuck with inventory, said, Were not doing that again. Were going to build 10 new units, and as they sell, well start the next one, etc. And then labor shortages are compounding the problems. The construction sector as a whole hasnt returned to the peak we saw prior to the Great Recession. We saw a lot of that labor leave the sector for something maybe perceived more stable, says the economist for a housing advisory firm. All these factors are conspiring to limit housing construction far below population growth. In fact, the number of single-family housing starts in the last decade (20102019) relative to house- hold formations was the lowest since the government began tracking these trends and half as much or less than in preced- ing decades, despite the consistent increase in deliveries since bottoming in 2010. And now both permits and housing starts have been trending down again in 2022.

Three, constrained construction of new supply, and a price run-up on the single-family for-sale front, spilled over into expanded apartment demand.  Lastly, compounding the effects of these four dramatic imbalances came the rocket fuel of a global capital rotation toward de-risked assets . Outsized demand, a sudden spike in remote work mobility, constricted supply, and floods of money with nowhere better to goa grand slam of anomalies. The U. S. apartment property sectorproviding shelter to 37 mil- lion residents in 21.3 million structures of five or more household units, and contributing $3.4 trillion annually to the U. S. economy, according to the NMHCmorphed quickly into an investment asset class pressure cooker. Inflated property valuations, com- pressed cap rates, and a sea change from individual owners to medium and large-sized corporate owners became a new norm seemingly overnight. This time period veers wildly from a steady slope of otherwise well-entrenched trends across the structural demand front. Operational modernization kicked into super-fast-forward mode toward self-service, and a robust new-development pipeline at least. According to a recent Bloomberg report, After dipping in 2020, the number of new units authorized in multifamily build- ings took off, running 37 percent higher over the past 12 months as of June 2022 than in the same period in 20182019. As of August, 862,000 apartments were under construction, up 25 percent from a year ago. At the same time, COVIDs aftermath sharply defined conflicting forceswhich together destine virtually all of Americas newly developed and built apartment communities for a financially privileged professional class. Rather than causing an expansion of rental housing stock, however, higher-income households come-lately demand for rental neighborhoods instead served to crowd out moderate- and lower-income households in supply- constrained areas.

Explains one academic, Investors are allowed to not only deduct everything, but also they can depreciate the unit. They also have access to lower cost of capital. In sum, institutional buyers assembling horizontal apartment portfolios can afford to pay more to be the high bidder for homes. And they do. Investors account for one in five homebuyers, up by a third compared with before the pandemic. Another supply constraint is homebuilders cautious construc- tion pacing, a vestige of the last recession. Explains the director of an investment institute who developed housing earlier in his career, A lot of the homebuilders, when the Great Recession happened, were stuck with inventory, said, Were not doing that again. Were going to build 10 new units, and as they sell, well start the next one, etc. And then labor shortages are compounding the problems. The construction sector as a whole hasnt returned to the peak we saw prior to the Great Recession. We saw a lot of that labor leave the sector for something maybe perceived more stable, says the economist for a housing advisory firm. All these factors are conspiring to limit housing construction far below population growth. In fact, the number of single-family housing starts in the last decade (20102019) relative to house- hold formations was the lowest since the government began tracking these trends and half as much or less than in preced- ing decades, despite the consistent increase in deliveries since bottoming in 2010. And now both permits and housing starts have been trending down again in 2022.

New building activity did not start to pick up until 2012 onwards, long after the surge in immigration after the turn of the century. On an aggregated basis across top locations, only around 20,000 homes p. a. were built from 2002 to 2011. Thereafter, completion figures rose to over 50,000 units up until 2018. Rising purchase prices, rental growth and higher investor demand made new builds lucrative. Between 2016 and 2019, building permits for 60,000 flats and more were issued every year, which means that even higher numbers of units could have been built. Instead, however, housing construction has been slowing down again since 2019  falling to around 40,000 units by 2021. Building in towns and cities was hampered by the fact that the construction industry was working more or less at capacity, by a shortage of skilled workers and of materials, along with the emergence of protests here and there. Now though, the construction industry faces much stronger head- wind, and consequently, completion figures are likely to decline further. A shortage of materials is being compounded by a rapid rise in construction costs  above all a huge rise in the price of building materials  along with higher financing costs.

New building activity did not start to pick up until 2012 onwards, long after the surge in immigration after the turn of the century. On an aggregated basis across top locations, only around 20,000 homes p. a. were built from 2002 to 2011. Thereafter, completion figures rose to over 50,000 units up until 2018. Rising purchase prices, rental growth and higher investor demand made new builds lucrative. Between 2016 and 2019, building permits for 60,000 flats and more were issued every year, which means that even higher numbers of units could have been built. Instead, however, housing construction has been slowing down again since 2019  falling to around 40,000 units by 2021. Building in towns and cities was hampered by the fact that the construction industry was working more or less at capacity, by a shortage of skilled workers and of materials, along with the emergence of protests here and there. Now though, the construction industry faces much stronger head- wind, and consequently, completion figures are likely to decline further. A shortage of materials is being compounded by a rapid rise in construction costs  above all a huge rise in the price of building materials  along with higher financing costs. A 30- year average shows that the cost of new build flats has increased by a good 3 per cent p. a. The increase in costs in 2018 and 2019 was considerably higher, but since 2021, it has been unprecedented: Construction costs rose by around 9 per cent in 2021 and, in the first half of 2022, they rose by almost 16 per cent!

And so everything has to be repriced, everything has to be reset.

As the partner in one lead- ing advisory firm explains, This is one of those cash is king situations where borrowing costs are higher, and if youre an all- cash buyer, those probably represent a disproportionate share of the people in the market today. Meanwhile, the same interest rate increases that reduce lever- aged returns and thus demand for real estate also make bonds and other interest-bearing investments more compelling. As the head of real estate banking at one investment bank explains, Rising bond yields are going to mean that real estate and other alternatives are all going to be facing less availability of capital and some outflows.;", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf", "page": 13, "Cluster": 75}, {"key": "real_estate_index:outlook-real-estatet-market-germany-dec-2022.pdf-!10", "text": "real_estate_index:outlook-real-estatet-market-germany-dec-2022.pdf-!10:  With the normalisation of monetary policy that has now begun, this situation should dissolve and the rise in real estate yields should be flatter than that of the risk-free interest rate. As a look at the early 1990s shows, prime real estate yields can even be below bond yields. Such a constellation presupposes high rental growth expectations. Given the current macro environment, we believe that investor expectations of rental growth are not sufficiently high for this in any sector. The logistics market and the less regulated part of the residential market might be an exception. But here, too, the uncertainty about further developments is likely to be too great, at least temporarily. Another relevant lower edge for property yields is financing costs. At the end of the third quarter of 2022, prime yields in all major market segments were below the cost of debt capital . This situation could only persist if the number of equity buyers is sufficiently large. Indeed, such investors are currently quite active and are taking advantage of the lower prices for purchases. However, we think it unlikely that the existing equity volume will be sufficient to anchor prices below the cost of financing. The fact that the increase in initial yields is nevertheless likely to be comparatively flat is also due to the mostly comfortable financing situation on the part of the landlords. Apart from the project development segment, we expect few forced sales. We rule out a wave of non-performing loans like after the financial crisis. Nevertheless, the steep rise in interest rates is likely to put individual landlords under stress, especially in the value-add and opportunistic segments, where financing durations are typically short. Lower demand for space and rents due to the recession could jeopardise the implementation of the business plan and thus also refinancing.;", "filename": "outlook-real-estatet-market-germany-dec-2022.pdf", "page": 6, "Cluster": 75}], "completion": "\n\nYes, due to the higher borrowing costs and prime yields being below the cost of debt capital, all-cash buyers gained more prominence in the market during the end of 2022, as evidenced by the sources [real_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!20] and [real_estate_index:outlook-real-estatet-market-germany-dec-2022.pdf-!10].", "ideal": "Yes"}, "created_by": null, "created_at": "2023-06-09 10:21:38.808535+00:00", "category": "SAME_WORDING_MULTIPLE_PARAGRAPHS"}

But here, too, the uncertainty about further developments is likely to be too great, at least temporarily. Another relevant lower edge for property yields is financing costs. At the end of the third quarter of 2022, prime yields in all major market segments were below the cost of debt capital . This situation could only persist if the number of equity buyers is sufficiently large. Indeed, such investors are currently quite active and are taking advantage of the lower prices for purchases. However, we think it unlikely that the existing equity volume will be sufficient to anchor prices below the cost of financing. The fact that the increase in initial yields is nevertheless likely to be comparatively flat is also due to the mostly comfortable financing situation on the part of the landlords. Apart from the project development segment, we expect few forced sales. We rule out a wave of non-performing loans like after the financial crisis. Nevertheless, the steep rise in interest rates is likely to put individual landlords under stress, especially in the value-add and opportunistic segments, where financing durations are typically short. Lower demand for space and rents due to the recession could jeopardise the implementation of the business plan and thus also refinancing.;\n***\n[Submission]: \n\nYes, due to the higher borrowing costs and prime yields being below the cost of debt capital, all-cash buyers gained more prominence in the market during the end of 2022, as evidenced by the sources [real_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!20] and [real_estate_index:outlook-real-estatet-market-germany-dec-2022.pdf-!10].\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.
