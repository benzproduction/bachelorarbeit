which markets and sectors are the most defensive? there are two schools of thought in answering this question. one would argue that higher yielding assets offer greater value protection as they have a wider spread to the rising bond yields, and in some cases leverage can still be accretive. yes, we think so. japans economic recovery has lagged. the labor market [SEP] [CLS] improved in 2022, but is still soft relative to 2019. october inflation at 3. 6 was the highest in four decades, but modest versus other countries. the pressure was also largely imported while domestic inflation stayed benign. in that context, maintaining the loose monetary policy appears the right thing to do. however, something has to give due to this diverging policy stance versus elsewhere. jpy succumbed to market forces and fell to a 32 - year low as a result, putting pressure on the bank of japans ( boj ) [SEP] [CLS] decision. in reaction, the ministry of finance intervened in the fx market for the first time since 1998 to stabilize the currency. page 4 of 8 the other would focus on fundamentals, and argue that even at a lower entry yield the potential for income growth over the investment period can mitigate some of the value depreciation from rising rates. we would side with the second argument. first, risk should define the yield. this means that assets with a higher risk profile will need to adjust to an even higher [SEP] [CLS] yield to maintain a risk premium over more core assets. and second, in a period of high inflation, the value of the income of an asset will erode unless it can generate rental growth. higher yielding assets generally come from sectors with weak occupational demand, hence the risk of void periods and negative rental growth are much higher, particularly during a period of economic stress. sectors including life sciences, student accommodation, cold", "filename": "global-real-estate-markets-2023.pdf"}, {"text": "the strongest performers over longer trailing periods and values have also fallen in the less favored sectors, although such adjustments are masked by lower price transparency in these property types. this repricing has [SEP] [CLS] been labeled mechanical by some because it is a function of exogenous debt assumptions increasing in investors spreadsheets. an alternative way to look at it is that it is mechanical because debt pricing is a mechanism by which real estate is linked to the broader capital markets, through lenders cost of funds. another such mechanism is the denominator effect. this involves comparing real - time values from public markets to lagging valuation - based assessments of private market portfolios, causing some inves [SEP] [CLS] tors to conclude that they are suddenly overweight in the unlisted assets compared to their target allocation. either way, the downward direction of the pricing pressure is clear and it will likely persist as long as the all - in cost of debt is dilutive to leveraged returns. given the same inputs, the math works the same way all over the world. but today those inputs to the math vary greatly, depending on local circumstances. in japan, debt costs have moved far less than in other parts of the world, as infla [SEP] [CLS] tion remains subdued and the bank of japan continues to exercise yield curve control. by contrast, europes real estate yield starting point was exceptionally low and market interest rates have moved up much more markedly, making the math that much more impactful. government policy also matters. as central banks seek to choke off inflation by tightening monetary policy, there is at least the reasonable expectation that some of that inflation will be passed into rents and thus property cash flows. but when g [SEP] [CLS] overnments employ long - term borrowing to bail out energy consumers in the short term, as is necessary in europe", "filename": "isa-outlook-2023.pdf"}, {"text": "storage logistics and self - storage where there are strong s [SEP] [CLS] tructural drivers to support rental growth, are expected to see the greatest value protection. this was welcome news for markets. while unlikely to change the jpy direction, we take comfort that both the government and the boj are on the same page. first, this helps to buy time until the us fed softens its hawkish stance. second, there is also a positive implication that the next boj governor due to be appointed in april 2023 will not deviate materially. to be clear, an exit from the ultra - loose policy is p [SEP] [CLS] ossible in the medium - term. however, it will most likely be done in a gradual manner. for 2023, at least, the current policy should stay and the chances are even higher now that the peak of global inflation and interest rates are drawing close. will japan remain an outlier market with low interest rates?
