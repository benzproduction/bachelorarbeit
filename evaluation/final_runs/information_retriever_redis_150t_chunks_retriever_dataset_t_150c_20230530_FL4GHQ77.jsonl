These transactions are also a reflection of the most important ten- ants in the first half, since public sector bodies and consultancies each accounted for roughly one quarter of total take-up. After a higher level of brand-new space coming onto the market in 2020 and 2021 than in previous years, less new space is ex- pected this year and next year, which should slow down the rise in prime rents.

This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy.

Moderating inflation rates this summer led many to believe that the worst was over and that the Fed could soon ease up its con- tractionary monetary policy.

Borrowers with a proven track record in hotel investment, as well as strong lender relationships, will have a competitive edge.

The math of debt costs and going-in yields is relentless. When the yield starting point is especially low in absolute terms, modest increases in debt costs and yields as measured in basis points mathematically translate into big percentage changes in capital values. As such, evidence of the most significant repricing to date has been concentrated in the lowest- yielding sectors, where transactions have held up most. This has surprised some observers since these low-yielding property types are mostly the winning sectors of recent years and they continue to possess attractive growth profiles.

Currently, it seems that debt costs are mostly winning the race. Ultimately, however, valuations are the result of the interaction between higher debt costs and the path of real estate fundamentals, the prospects for which vary widely across sectors and geographies. Tracing back real estate cash flows to their drivers is to follow a chain of causation back to basic variables like population, GDP, industrial production, consumer spending and employment. All of these interact with real estate factors, such as the balance of property supply and occupier demand, to influence property cash flows. Secular megatrends and structural features like legal and contractual constraints also matter.

This repricing has been labeled mechanical by some because it is a function of exogenous debt assumptions increasing in investors spreadsheets. An alternative way to look at it is that it is mechanical because debt pricing is a mechanism by which real estate is linked to the broader capital markets, through lenders cost of funds. Another such mechanism is the denominator effect. This involves comparing real-time values from public markets to lagging valuation-based assessments of private market portfolios, causing some investors to conclude that they are suddenly overweight in the unlisted assets compared to their target allocation. Either way, the downward direction of the pricing pressure is clear and it will likely persist as long as the all-in cost of debt is dilutive to leveraged returns.

And while interest rates are increasing, equity and bond prices have been falling, triggering the denominator effect for some institutional investors with asset allocations that must remain in balance. The denominator effect can be magnified because CRE values in a portfolio are generally appraisal-based, which tend to be backward-looking.

By contrast, Europes real estate yield starting point was exceptionally low and market interest rates have moved up much more markedly, making the math that much more impactful. Government policy also matters. As central banks seek to choke off inflation by tightening monetary policy, there is at least the reasonable expectation that some of that inflation will be passed into rents and thus property cash flows. But when governments employ long-term borrowing to bail out energy consumers in the short term, as is necessary in Europe, interest rates are pushed up further and the impact on property values may be more detrimental.

Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy.

At the latest from 2015, when the ECB began extensive government bond purchases, the Bund yield was kept artificially low. The difference to initial property yields was distorted as a result. With the normalisation of monetary policy that has now begun, this situation should dissolve and the rise in real estate yields should be flatter than that of the risk-free interest rate. As a look at the early 1990s shows, prime real estate yields can even be below bond yields. Such a constellation presupposes high rental growth expectations.

These methods can dramatically reduce the need for labor and shrink production times at more affordable costs. Promising innovations are also arising from the nascent single-fam- ily build-to-rent sector, which is learning how to scale construction and design to reduce costs and development time, as explained in our single-family sector overview found in chapter 2.

A wave of charging options paired with renewable energy storage methods will impact multifamily and retail in the coming years. Net-zero disclosure requirements are expected to increase, which will put pressure on landlords to offer ways of tracking energy consumption and carbon emissions by tenant. To do this, asset owners may opt to develop a digital twin of their asset that collects real time information from thousands of sensors in the building. Governments will ramp up subsidies to incentivize less wasteful development and greener buildings. The largest government programs spend subsidies via the private lending community that will do a green assessment in exchange for lower financing costs at origination. However, we may see increased pressure by regulators to also monitor the asset during the loans life, further increasing the need for a standard tech solution. The sector is also captive for taxation when governments eventually look to pay down debts built up over the pandemic.

At the latest from 2015, when the ECB began extensive government bond purchases, the Bund yield was kept artificially low. The difference to initial property yields was distorted as a result. With the normalisation of monetary policy that has now begun, this situation should dissolve and the rise in real estate yields should be flatter than that of the risk-free interest rate. As a look at the early 1990s shows, prime real estate yields can even be below bond yields. Such a constellation presupposes high rental growth expectations. Given the current macro environment, we believe that investor expectations of rental growth are not sufficiently high for this in any sector. The logistics market and the less regulated part of the residential market might be an exception.

Currently, it seems that debt costs are mostly winning the race.

As central banks seek to choke off inflation by tightening monetary policy, there is at least the reasonable expectation that some of that inflation will be passed into rents and thus property cash flows. But when governments employ long-term borrowing to bail out energy consumers in the short term, as is necessary in Europe, interest rates are pushed up further and the impact on property values may be more detrimental.

Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy.

Moderating inflation rates this summer led many to believe that the worst was over and that the Fed could soon ease up its con- tractionary monetary policy.

Given the high debt levels in many euro countries, they are likely to remain structurally low, probably negative. In this case, borrowers can let inflation work for them, which means they have to pay back less purchasing power than they have borrowed. Another factor is inflation protection.

Currently, it seems that debt costs are mostly winning the race. Ultimately, however, valuations are the result of the interaction between higher debt costs and the path of real estate fundamentals, the prospects for which vary widely across sectors and geographies.

In this case, a bank would not suffer any damage from a workout. Secondly, in an environment of rising interest rates, lenders can use the equity released from repaid loans to grant new, higher-interest loans. In this respect, it could be that lenders in many cases are aiming for a speedy redemption of loans. In addition to refinancing issues, there are other reasons for an increasing number of sales. For example, the devaluation of equities and bonds may have led to real estate quotas above target in some portfolios. This could trigger sales.

Indeed, the short-lived government of Liz Truss in the UK, which advanced ideologically driven tax cuts in addition to considerable fiscal largesse on energy bills, has given the country a keener sense of the maximum level of fiscal irresponsibility that international sovereign bond markets will tolerate. This is on top of the fact that sovereign bond market patience will be robustly tested by central bank efforts to scale down balance sheets bloated by quantitative easing (QE).

From the point of view of most occupiers, space will therefore remain scarce and expensive, especially since the initially still high inflation will eat up any savings in cold rent through higher costs elsewhere. In view of this dynamic, risk-taking investors and those for whom real estate is an investment that needs to be actively managed are likely to get their moneys worth in 2023. Asset management could become the buzzword of the year. In view of the major trends of digitalisation and decarbonisation, it could well be not just a year, but an era of asset management.

Too Much for Too Many  Housing affordability has fallen to its lowest level in over 30 years. Prices and rents have soared relative to incomes. Spiraling mortgage rates have pushed the homeownership bar further out of reach for a growing share of households.  The chronic undersupply of housing is the result of govern- ment policies that limit new supply or increase construction costs and is exacerbated by a labor shortage, as well as NIMBYism.  Simply constructing more housing may be the most obvious and effective solution, but is far from easy to achieve. Housing is too expensive. It has been that way for too longfor too many people neither for-sale nor rental housing is afford- ablebut prices and rents have soared even further out of reach over the course of the past year.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " Moving to More Affordable Recent slowdowns in rent growth and home price appreciation, noted in our Normalizing trend, have done little to increase affordability.

Demand will continue to rise, especially as the Canadian government com- mits to higher immigration targets in the coming years and the country welcomes large numbers of temporary residents, like international students, who also need places to live. This means that even as homebuilding activity has been rising, tight market conditions have put pressures on affordability that are unlikely to ease significantly. As we noted, some interviewees are looking at pausing housing developmentsoften condo projectsas they deal with cost and financing challenges as well as soften- ing demand due to rising interest rates. As that happens, and especially if projections of cancellations continue to materialize, the supply and affordability challenge will not go away even if the housing market cools for the time being.

Ironically, the affordability challenges extend to a subgroup we call the Affordable West. These markets are, indeed, more affordable than the ultra-pricey West Coast markets, especially those in California. But population growth has outpaced hous- ing development, pushing up home prices faster than local incomes. Much of the population growth in these markets has been fueled by the in-migration of households seeking more affordable housing, suggesting that growth could soon slow in some of these markets, absent an easing in home prices.

Affordable housing developers complain that increasingly complex deals now require more underwriting from more capital sources. One developer says, The average deal for us used to take 90 days to close, and now its over six months. Some experts we interviewed believe that the rise of single- family rentals (SFRs) also contributes to declining affordability of for-sale housing.

Several industry leaders we interviewed noted that Washingtons divided political climate was unlikely to yield any significant changes to the essential tax structures and accounting regula- tions that govern commercial real estate.

Housing costs and availability ranked as the top social political issue among survey respondents this year, and it comes as no surprise as affordability matters continued to rise and reached crisis levels in some areas of Canada in 2022. We can see the evidence in RBC Economics housing affordability index report, which showed that ownership costs as a percent- age of median household income reached 59.3 percent for single-family homes at the start of 2022. Moves by the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates as part of its bid to tackle inflation are having an impact on home prices. But higher interest rates will counteract the affordability impacts of any easing of home prices, at least for the time being.

Financial factorsgiven that runaway costs and high mortgage interest rates will price more households out of homeownership as an optionwill determine many of their decisions, as has long been the case. What is different over the past several years has been growth in discretionary rental households, also known as rent-by-choice households. According to Harvards Joint Center for Housing Studies (JCHS), the number of renters making at least $75,000 jumped by 48 percent over the decade ending just before the pandemic, to 11.3 million.

Further boosting demand is the increasing number of younger adults choosing to live alone, according The multifamily sector has responded with an unprecedented increase in new supply. Weve built more multifamily housing units over the last 10 years than we had in any other time since 1980, notes an adviser to institutional investors. But it is still far less than needed. Vacancies have fallen to their lowest levels ever while rents are rising faster than evereven faster than home prices.

Demographics and the slowing economy could also help ease the housing imbalance. The nations population is growing at its slowest pace ever, thanks to both low birth and immigration rates. And fewer buyers are on the hunt for homes now due to affordability and concerns about possible job losses in a recession. The good news is that it is an opportunity for home- builders and land developers to do a little catch-up. Theyve been running behind for two years, and they may actually welcome a little respite to finish the homes that they have sold, thinks a senior adviser to many homebuilders. But these favorable trends alone will not be nearly enough to solve the affordability quandary.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " Due to the sharp rise in financing costs, many households can no longer afford to buy their own home and remain tenants. While demand for rental housing is unexpectedly high, conversely, construction completion figures must be assumed to be falling instead of rising. Higher interest rates and construction costs have made projects massively more expensive. Expected sales prices, on the other hand, have fallen. This has led to a halt in many construction projects. Instead of 400,000 completed flats per year, as targeted by the federal government, a figure 200,000 new flats in 2023 seems much more likely. In 2024, it is likely to be even lower. The supply-demand relationship is thus out of balance as rarely before . In the next few years, we therefore expect the already very low vacancy rates in most rental housing markets to fall further and rents to rise. From the landlords point of view, the fundamental framework conditions not only remain favourable, the outlook has even improved compared to last year.

Migration away from Canadas largest cities which still tend to see population increases as a result of high rates of international immigrationhas been a trend for some time, but the growth of remote working during the pandemic has exacerbated the move outwards and helped make affordability pressures more widespread.

Given the high debt levels in many euro countries, they are likely to remain structurally low, probably negative. In this case, borrowers can let inflation work for them, which means they have to pay back less purchasing power than they have borrowed. Another factor is inflation protection. In periods of high inflation, house and apartment prices increased faster than inflation. This is likely to be the case this time as well, especially against the backdrop of the high supply shortage.

Reflecting the view of several CRE leaders we interviewed, a senior executive with a global devel- opment and investment firm said, My gut says were going to have a recession, but its going to be relatively mild compared to some of the more severe recessions weve had.

By contrast, Europes real estate yield starting point was exceptionally low and market interest rates have moved up much more markedly, making the math that much more impactful. Government policy also matters. As central banks seek to choke off inflation by tightening monetary policy, there is at least the reasonable expectation that some of that inflation will be passed into rents and thus property cash flows. But when governments employ long-term borrowing to bail out energy consumers in the short term, as is necessary in Europe, interest rates are pushed up further and the impact on property values may be more detrimental. As the UKs recent experience would suggest, credit markets can react swiftly to reflect changes in perceived debt sustainability.

UBS Asset Management Weve narrowed it down to A year ago, the world remained in the grips of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Omicron variant had just emerged. 12 months on and the pandemic has largely subsided, only to be replaced by a brutal war in Ukraine and inflation reaching multi-decade highs. This prompted central banks to make aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022, with more expected in 2023, along with a mild recession in the economy. Looking back to our 2022 predictions, in general they proved prescient. We expected hybrid working to weigh on the office market and that the polarization between the best and worst assets would continue, which has been the case. We expected retail capital values to bottom out, which they had started to, but are now likely to be impacted by weakening consumer spending.

According to Statistics Canada, residential building costs were up 22.6 percent on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter of 2022. For nonresidential construction, cost increases were lower but still significant at 12.8 percent.

Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy.

The following consequences are likely to result from an environment with structurally high inflation, a tendency toward somewhat higher nominal interest rates and negative real interest rates. First, prices will probably remain under pressure until the end of the interest rate hikes. Second, highly leveraged projects are significantly riskier than in the past decade, which should put the brakes on risk-taking investors. This scenario would therefore continue to allow risk-averse, long-term investors to achieve decent returns. 4.5 Risk scenario for 2023 and later: Structurally high inflation There are two main reasons why inflation could continue to spike upward.

Which markets and sectors are the most defensive? There are two schools of thought in answering this question. One would argue that higher yielding assets offer greater value protection as they have a wider spread to the rising bond yields, and in some cases leverage can still be accretive. Yes, we think so. Japans economic recovery has lagged. The labor market improved in 2022, but is still soft relative to 2019. October inflation at 3.6 was the highest in four decades, but modest versus other countries. The pressure was also largely imported while domestic inflation stayed benign.

The ECB and BoE will continue to raise interest rates to defend currencies to avoid importing more inflation and to manage the inflationary effects of Europes tight labor markets. However, with core price pressures less pronounced than in the US and weaker long-term demographic drivers of inflation in Europe, it is likely that both the peak level and equilibrium rate of monetary policy will be lower in Continental Europe than in the US.

The odds of a recession in the next twelve months are increasing, but are still below those of other regions, especially Europe. However, if global inflation persists longer than anticipated, central banks would need to hold interest rates higher for longer and it could take either a severe recession or an exogenous shock to bring down inflation. Under this scenario, the relative economic strength of Asia Pacific could diminish. Asia Pacific is remarkable in that the policymakers of its two largest economies, China and Japan, are implementing monetary policies that are distinctively different from those of other major central banks .

So, a number of important topics for us and investors to consider. We hope you find our answers insightful and useful in determining your strategy and thinking about some of the key questions in real estate as we move into the new year. Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy. Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process.

In our view, only the best development situations, with lower land bases and top tier sites, still make economic sense. The challenge should not be leasing up new developments but reaching a yield-on-cost at a sufficient spread to the higher interest and capitalization rates. In the US and Canada, higher interest rates are hurting house price affordability. As buying becomes out of reach for more households, this will boost residential rental demand. This is likely to be most beneficial for single-family homes for rent and suburban apartments and less impactful on urban apartments.

New Horizons Still, not all recessions are alike, and most economists, as well as Emerging Trends interviewees, expect any recession to be relatively short and shallow.

One would argue that higher yielding assets offer greater value protection as they have a wider spread to the rising bond yields, and in some cases leverage can still be accretive. Yes, we think so. Japans economic recovery has lagged. The labor market improved in 2022, but is still soft relative to 2019. October inflation at 3.6 was the highest in four decades, but modest versus other countries. The pressure was also largely imported while domestic inflation stayed benign.

We would side with the second argument. First, risk should define the yield. This means that assets with a higher risk profile will need to adjust to an even higher yield to maintain a risk premium over more core assets. And second, in a period of high inflation, the value of the income of an asset will erode unless it can generate rental growth.

The ECB and BoE will continue to raise interest rates to defend currencies to avoid importing more inflation and to manage the inflationary effects of Europes tight labor markets.

The artificially low interest rates have made the money and bond market unattractive for many years. In addition, central banks have squeezed private investors out of the market with their securities purchase programmes and forced them to invest their money elsewhere, including in real estate. If this period now comes to an end, it could result in a countervailing reallocation process.

While demand for rental housing is unexpectedly high, conversely, construction completion figures must be assumed to be falling instead of rising. Higher interest rates and construction costs have made projects massively more expensive. Expected sales prices, on the other hand, have fallen. This has led to a halt in many construction projects. Instead of 400,000 completed flats per year, as targeted by the federal government, a figure 200,000 new flats in 2023 seems much more likely. In 2024, it is likely to be even lower. The supply-demand relationship is thus out of balance as rarely before . In the next few years, we therefore expect the already very low vacancy rates in most rental housing markets to fall further and rents to rise.

We think it is conceivable that 400,000 flats per year will actually be completed in the next legislative period. But even then it would still take years to reduce the accumulated surplus demand. In the short term, therefore, policymakers could further tighten rent regulation to at least alleviate the symptoms of the housing shortage.

Looking back to our 2022 predictions, in general they proved prescient.

We expected retail capital values to bottom out, which they had started to, but are now likely to be impacted by weakening consumer spending.

The residential sector as a whole is a beneficiary of the ongoing trend of urbanisation in major cities across Europe. Wealth tends to be concentrated in larger urban centres with better employment opportunities where the average age of the working population is lower than in regional and more remote communities. Demand for living assets remains strong in most urbanised areas due to demographic growth and the rising number of households, boosted by immigration and the expanding number of younger and older people living alone. The volume of new housing developments is also falling due to increasingly stringent environmental rules, shortages of materials and rising labour costs. Demand continues to outstrip supply, especially in the affordable segment. If the number of new-build projects continues to decline, the valuations of existing stock may hold up relatively well.

In principle, many investment managers and other capital collection agencies still have plenty of money to invest, and capital sources such as insurance companies and pension institutions are continuously receiving more money to invest. However, the trend in recent years of more and more of this money flowing into the real estate markets may have been broken with the turnaround in interest rates. The artificially low interest rates have made the money and bond market unattractive for many years. In addition, central banks have squeezed private investors out of the market with their securities purchase programmes and forced them to invest their money elsewhere, including in real estate. If this period now comes to an end, it could result in a countervailing reallocation process. In combination with monetary tightening, there would then be less money available for real estate investments than before until the long-term growth trend gains the upper hand again. From a German perspective, there is another question: how safe is Germany still perceived as an investment haven?

Economists point to elevated vulnerabilities in global housing markets and a risk of a sudden price reversal if financial conditions were to tighten significantly.23 However, some fundamental forces can help explain why pricing appreciation may endure, albeit slower than the recent torrid pace: better homeowner financial stability and lasting supply constraints.

Investment approaches that structure around uncertainty are those where the investor acknowledges value uncertainty, but the investments have characteristics such that outcomes are not dependent on resolving that uncertainty in a specific way. Senior and junior lending at defensible attachment points are thus attractive today, especially given the widening in debt pricing and if in floating-rate constructs. Structuring contractual features into equity investments that insulate investment outcomes from key uncertainties can also be effective. Finally, investors are wise to identify strategies that take advantage of market dislocation. For example, we see opportunities in the heavily repriced listed real estate markets and expect to see them in the indirect space as secondary fund interests find price discovery. We also recommend positioning to acquire assets at distressed pricing in markets being hit most by capital pricing and availability challenges, such as Europe.", "filename": "isa-outlook-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " Winning sectors like residential and logistics have consistently posted stronger returns than pandemic-challenged sectors like retail or hotels . In both public and private markets, the data show that the dispersion between the strongest and weakest performing sectors is exceptionally wide.

This tends to create a time lag between higher interest rates and declines in private equity real estate pricing. In most markets globally, we are now feeling the impact of more expensive real estate debt, which in many cases is no longer accretive to returns at current private market valuations. The math of debt costs and going-in yields is relentless. When the yield starting point is especially low in absolute terms, modest increases in debt costs and yields as measured in basis points mathematically translate into big percentage changes in capital values. As such, evidence of the most significant repricing to date has been concentrated in the lowest- yielding sectors, where transactions have held up most. This has surprised some observers since these low-yielding property types are mostly the winning sectors of recent years and they continue to possess attractive growth profiles.

Currently, it seems that debt costs are mostly winning the race. Ultimately, however, valuations are the result of the interaction between higher debt costs and the path of real estate fundamentals, the prospects for which vary widely across sectors and geographies. Tracing back real estate cash flows to their drivers is to follow a chain of causation back to basic variables like population, GDP, industrial production, consumer spending and employment. All of these interact with real estate factors, such as the balance of property supply and occupier demand, to influence property cash flows. Secular megatrends and structural features like legal and contractual constraints also matter. Going into 2023, there is increased uncertainty in many of these variables, especially the economic ones, given the pace of economic expansion is expected to be weaker or negative.", "filename": "isa-outlook-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " The bid- ask spread for private real estate should eventually close and transactions will resume in earnest at a rebased level.  In the meantime, investment styles that are less sensitive to volatility in values should be contemplated, such as floating-rate lending with a comfortable cushion from lower loan-to-value ratios. Debt investment can be attractive at times of uncertainty, as investors tilt toward contractually certain income and away from an uncertain upside. Portfolio aggregation strategies with smaller asset sizes that lend themselves to averaging-in with diversified timing of entry points represent another way to cope with volatile and uncertain values.  The inputs to the math are not changing to the same degree in every part of the world. Wherever rate spikes are less intense, or the prospects for rental growth are clearest, transaction activity and prices have been less impacted.  In addition to debt costs, investors should also consider the trajectory of cash flows, which depend on economic fundamentals and real estate occupier market conditions.

This repricing has been labeled mechanical by some because it is a function of exogenous debt assumptions increasing in investors spreadsheets. An alternative way to look at it is that it is mechanical because debt pricing is a mechanism by which real estate is linked to the broader capital markets, through lenders cost of funds. Another such mechanism is the denominator effect. This involves comparing real-time values from public markets to lagging valuation-based assessments of private market portfolios, causing some investors to conclude that they are suddenly overweight in the unlisted assets compared to their target allocation. Either way, the downward direction of the pricing pressure is clear and it will likely persist as long as the all-in cost of debt is dilutive to leveraged returns.

It was a speculative question, with the underlying assumption that rate increases thus far had not yet impacted values. Regardless of the answer then, it became very clear in 2022 that the relentless math of higher borrowing rates was having an impact on leveraged returns and asset values . The boost investors were getting from borrowing has shifted to a drag on a cash basis, but with unleveraged internal rates of return generally above borrowing rates, leverage is still marginally accretive on a total return basis. However, with less lift from borrowing, leveraged buyers are largely out of the market . Higher borrowing rates are a function of both higher indices and increased borrowing spreads.

In addition, lenders may become more averse to lodging assets in drive-to leisure destinations and more enthusiastic about assets in traditional gateway markets, if group and individual business travel continues to increase. Borrowers with a proven track record in hotel investment, as well as strong lender relationships, will have a competitive edge. The impacts of climate change are becoming increasingly more apparent with the increased rate of natural disasters, flooding, and abnormal weather patterns.

The denominator effect can be magnified because CRE values in a portfolio are generally appraisal-based, which tend to be backward-looking.

While unleveraged buyers are not directly impacted by higher interest rates, they are also shifting their pricing and buying activity.

We hope you find our answers insightful and useful in determining your strategy and thinking about some of the key questions in real estate as we move into the new year. Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy.

As central banks seek to choke off inflation by tightening monetary policy, there is at least the reasonable expectation that some of that inflation will be passed into rents and thus property cash flows.

The End of the Beginning But there is one issue on which our interviewees agree: The exis- tential risk for the real estate economy right now is that Fed action in response to persistent inflation will tip us into a recession, says a senior partner with a leading advisory firm. But can the Federal Reserve Bank tame inflation without breaking the economy? Moderating inflation rates this summer led many to believe that the worst was over and that the Fed could soon ease up its con- tractionary monetary policy. Indeed, the consensus of experts we interviewed this summer was that the Fed would cease tightening by the end of 2022 and start cutting rates again in mid-2023.

In addition, we analyze how opportunistic and value-add managers will need to adopt their strategies now that interest rates are higher, and how their ability to generate out-size returns simply by adding leverage is gone. So, a number of important topics for us and investors to consider. We hope you find our answers insightful and useful in determining your strategy and thinking about some of the key questions in real estate as we move into the new year. Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy. Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs.", "filename": "global-real-estate-markets-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " Sentiment started changing in late August when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell gave his annual speech to fellow central bankers affirming the Fed view that infla- tion is not nearly under control, jolting markets.

As Winston Churchill famously cautioned after the British army won a critical WWII battle, the victory marked not the end, not even the beginning of the end, but, possibly, the end of the beginning. 4 Higher for Longer With interest rates headed higher for longer, the risk of a deeper, full-fledged recession is rising, according to a grow- ing consensus of economists. In an August 2022 survey by the National Association of Business Economics, only a quarter of economists were even somewhat confident that the Fed could bring down inflation to its target range without causing a recession.

It was a speculative question, with the underlying assumption that rate increases thus far had not yet impacted values. Regardless of the answer then, it became very clear in 2022 that the relentless math of higher borrowing rates was having an impact on leveraged returns and asset values . The boost investors were getting from borrowing has shifted to a drag on a cash basis, but with unleveraged internal rates of return generally above borrowing rates, leverage is still marginally accretive on a total return basis. However, with less lift from borrowing, leveraged buyers are largely out of the market . Higher borrowing rates are a function of both higher indices and increased borrowing spreads. Lending volume is down significantly and lenders are becoming more conservative. The supply of debt capital from large money center banks is down due to large positions taken in the first half of 2022 coupled with stress testing.", "filename": "isa-outlook-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " The resultant rise in the cost of debt and the tightening spread between average real estate yields and the risk-free rate will lead to asset repricing, potentially generating opportunities for non-leveraged investors, who may be better placed than leveraged buyers with refinancing commitments.

New Horizons Still, not all recessions are alike, and most economists, as well as Emerging Trends interviewees, expect any recession to be relatively short and shallow. Reflecting the view of several CRE leaders we interviewed, a senior executive with a global devel- opment and investment firm said, My gut says were going to have a recession, but its going to be relatively mild compared to some of the more severe recessions weve had.

Now the litmus test is upon us. In addition to the fundamental supply shortage, there are a number of other factors that tend to raise prices. For example, adjusted for inflation, the price decline in 2022 was already very strong. In addition, the very negative real interest rates are currently an incentive to invest. Given the high debt levels in many euro countries, they are likely to remain structurally low, probably negative. In this case, borrowers can let inflation work for them, which means they have to pay back less purchasing power than they have borrowed. Another factor is inflation protection. In periods of high inflation, house and apartment prices increased faster than inflation. This is likely to be the case this time as well, especially against the backdrop of the high supply shortage. Last but not least, rents are starting to pick up. Admittedly, the strict regulatory environment argues against strong rent increases.", "filename": "2023_Housing_market_outlook__Price_dip_and_interes.pdf"}, {"text": " Not everyone is as sanguine as the CEO of an investment management firm who provided our opening quote, and there certainly are some troubling risks ahead for the industry.

It makes sense that real estate experts would take the long view given the nature of real estate assets: buildings take a long time to conceive and develop. Even simply acquiring one typically takes more time than buying just about any other type of financial asset, and they are usually held for longer dura- tions. Still, the willingness of so many people in the industry to look beyond some of the cyclical headwinds is striking. Says the head of advisory services for a commercial real estate (CRE) analytics firm, The recessionif we go into onewill obviously impact some markets worse than others, but its just like any- thing else.

In principle, many investment managers and other capital collection agencies still have plenty of money to invest, and capital sources such as insurance companies and pension institutions are continuously receiving more money to invest. However, the trend in recent years of more and more of this money flowing into the real estate markets may have been broken with the turnaround in interest rates. The artificially low interest rates have made the money and bond market unattractive for many years. In addition, central banks have squeezed private investors out of the market with their securities purchase programmes and forced them to invest their money elsewhere, including in real estate. If this period now comes to an end, it could result in a countervailing reallocation process. In combination with monetary tightening, there would then be less money available for real estate investments than before until the long-term growth trend gains the upper hand again. From a German perspective, there is another question: how safe is Germany still perceived as an investment haven?

And while interest rates are increasing, equity and bond prices have been falling, triggering the denominator effect for some institutional investors with asset allocations that must remain in balance. The denominator effect can be magnified because CRE values in a portfolio are generally appraisal-based, which tend to be backward-looking.

One would argue that higher yielding assets offer greater value protection as they have a wider spread to the rising bond yields, and in some cases leverage can still be accretive. Yes, we think so. Japans economic recovery has lagged. The labor market improved in 2022, but is still soft relative to 2019. October inflation at 3.6 was the highest in four decades, but modest versus other countries. The pressure was also largely imported while domestic inflation stayed benign.

Page 4 of 8 The other would focus on fundamentals, and argue that even at a lower entry yield the potential for income growth over the investment period can mitigate some of the value depreciation from rising rates. We would side with the second argument. First, risk should define the yield. This means that assets with a higher risk profile will need to adjust to an even higher yield to maintain a risk premium over more core assets. And second, in a period of high inflation, the value of the income of an asset will erode unless it can generate rental growth. Higher yielding assets generally come from sectors with weak occupational demand, hence the risk of void periods and negative rental growth are much higher, particularly during a period of economic stress.", "filename": "global-real-estate-markets-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " In Japan, debt costs have moved far less than in other parts of the world, as inflation remains subdued and the Bank of Japan continues to exercise yield curve control . By contrast, Europes real estate yield starting point was exceptionally low and market interest rates have moved up much more markedly, making the math that much more impactful. Government policy also matters. As central banks seek to choke off inflation by tightening monetary policy, there is at least the reasonable expectation that some of that inflation will be passed into rents and thus property cash flows. But when governments employ long-term borrowing to bail out energy consumers in the short term, as is necessary in Europe, interest rates are pushed up further and the impact on property values may be more detrimental.

With the normalisation of monetary policy that has now begun, this situation should dissolve and the rise in real estate yields should be flatter than that of the risk-free interest rate. As a look at the early 1990s shows, prime real estate yields can even be below bond yields. Such a constellation presupposes high rental growth expectations. Given the current macro environment, we believe that investor expectations of rental growth are not sufficiently high for this in any sector.

Firstly, the volume of completed space will be comparatively high, at least in the next two years, and will ensure a greater supply of modern office space. Secondly, the economic downturn will, at least temporarily, bring the cost side back into sharper focus for companies - this will also influence their willingness to pay for office space. Thirdly, and this is presumably the strongest effect, the increased demands on office space quality are offset by a lower quantitative demand.

In view of this dynamic, risk-taking investors and those for whom real estate is an investment that needs to be actively managed are likely to get their moneys worth in 2023. Asset management could become the buzzword of the year. In view of the major trends of digitalisation and decarbonisation, it could well be not just a year, but an era of asset management. But that is a topic for another outlook. Conclusion Despite all the uncertainty, one thing seems certain in our view for the real estate year 2023: it will remain challenging for all market players.

If, despite this, there is an increase in the sale of buildings with high emissions as a result of media coverage and social and political pressure, then they could be purchased cheap and renovations deliberately omitted. In the short term, it should thus be possible to achieve excess returns.

We hope you find our answers insightful and useful in determining your strategy and thinking about some of the key questions in real estate as we move into the new year. Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy. Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process.

October inflation at 3.6 was the highest in four decades, but modest versus other countries. The pressure was also largely imported while domestic inflation stayed benign.

As central banks seek to choke off inflation by tightening monetary policy, there is at least the reasonable expectation that some of that inflation will be passed into rents and thus property cash flows. But when governments employ long-term borrowing to bail out energy consumers in the short term, as is necessary in Europe, interest rates are pushed up further and the impact on property values may be more detrimental.

With the normalisation of monetary policy that has now begun, this situation should dissolve and the rise in real estate yields should be flatter than that of the risk-free interest rate.

However, the trend in recent years of more and more of this money flowing into the real estate markets may have been broken with the turnaround in interest rates. The artificially low interest rates have made the money and bond market unattractive for many years. In addition, central banks have squeezed private investors out of the market with their securities purchase programmes and forced them to invest their money elsewhere, including in real estate. If this period now comes to an end, it could result in a countervailing reallocation process.

Currently, it seems that debt costs are mostly winning the race. Ultimately, however, valuations are the result of the interaction between higher debt costs and the path of real estate fundamentals, the prospects for which vary widely across sectors and geographies. Tracing back real estate cash flows to their drivers is to follow a chain of causation back to basic variables like population, GDP, industrial production, consumer spending and employment. All of these interact with real estate factors, such as the balance of property supply and occupier demand, to influence property cash flows.

However, with less lift from borrowing, leveraged buyers are largely out of the market . Higher borrowing rates are a function of both higher indices and increased borrowing spreads.

One would argue that higher yielding assets offer greater value protection as they have a wider spread to the rising bond yields, and in some cases leverage can still be accretive. Yes, we think so. Japans economic recovery has lagged. The labor market improved in 2022, but is still soft relative to 2019. October inflation at 3.6 was the highest in four decades, but modest versus other countries. The pressure was also largely imported while domestic inflation stayed benign.

We would side with the second argument. First, risk should define the yield. This means that assets with a higher risk profile will need to adjust to an even higher yield to maintain a risk premium over more core assets. And second, in a period of high inflation, the value of the income of an asset will erode unless it can generate rental growth.

By contrast, Europes real estate yield starting point was exceptionally low and market interest rates have moved up much more markedly, making the math that much more impactful. Government policy also matters. As central banks seek to choke off inflation by tightening monetary policy, there is at least the reasonable expectation that some of that inflation will be passed into rents and thus property cash flows. But when governments employ long-term borrowing to bail out energy consumers in the short term, as is necessary in Europe, interest rates are pushed up further and the impact on property values may be more detrimental.

Instead of 400,000 completed flats per year, as targeted by the federal government, a figure 200,000 new flats in 2023 seems much more likely. In 2024, it is likely to be even lower.

Technology can play a bigger role in actually delivering homes by helping bring innovation and cost efficiencies to a sector that has been notoriously slow to change. Most notable are different approaches to prefabricated and modular housing in which much or all of the house is built in a factory and then assembled on the homesite. These methods can dramatically reduce the need for labor and shrink production times at more affordable costs. Promising innovations are also arising from the nascent single-fam- ily build-to-rent sector, which is learning how to scale construction and design to reduce costs and development time, as explained in our single-family sector overview found in chapter 2.

Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy.

This prompted central banks to make aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022, with more expected in 2023, along with a mild recession in the economy.

We expected retail capital values to bottom out, which they had started to, but are now likely to be impacted by weakening consumer spending.

Currently, it seems that debt costs are mostly winning the race. Ultimately, however, valuations are the result of the interaction between higher debt costs and the path of real estate fundamentals, the prospects for which vary widely across sectors and geographies. Tracing back real estate cash flows to their drivers is to follow a chain of causation back to basic variables like population, GDP, industrial production, consumer spending and employment.

Proponents argue that SFRs extend the opportunity to live in a single-family house to those who cannot afford to buy or just dont want to, while generally expanding the supply of rental housing.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " Even if affordability eventually improves with falling housing prices, the reality is that the key issue underpinning the crisis is insufficient sup- ply to meet high demand for all types of homes. Demand will continue to rise, especially as the Canadian government com- mits to higher immigration targets in the coming years and the country welcomes large numbers of temporary residents, like international students, who also need places to live. This means that even as homebuilding activity has been rising, tight market conditions have put pressures on affordability that are unlikely to ease significantly. As we noted, some interviewees are looking at pausing housing developmentsoften condo projectsas they deal with cost and financing challenges as well as soften- ing demand due to rising interest rates. As that happens, and especially if projections of cancellations continue to materialize, the supply and affordability challenge will not go away even if the housing market cools for the time being. And, as the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. (CMHC) noted earlier in 2022, the number of new units required to restore reasonable affordability levels is high.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " A key social issue for real estate, of course, is housing afford- ability. Housing costs and availability ranked as the top social political issue among survey respondents this year, and it comes as no surprise as affordability matters continued to rise and reached crisis levels in some areas of Canada in 2022. We can see the evidence in RBC Economics housing affordability index report, which showed that ownership costs as a percent- age of median household income reached 59.3 percent for single-family homes at the start of 2022. Moves by the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates as part of its bid to tackle inflation are having an impact on home prices. But higher interest rates will counteract the affordability impacts of any easing of home prices, at least for the time being. And overall affordability pressures are affecting other classes of residential real estate as rising interest rates and the resulting challenges faced by homebuyers in qualifying for financing under the mortgage stress test push many potential purchasers to try to rent a home instead.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " 46 65 G Exhibit 2-9 Reasons Renters Continue to Rent, Based on Rental Households That Believe Homeownership Is Important Exhibit 2-10 Footprint Allocated to the Homes Outdoor Space, 2021 versus 2020 58 47 67 35 Need to save for downpayment Life circumstances Cannot afford mortgage payments 37 34 Lack of supply 28 11 Require the exibility to move if desiredneeded Cannot take on the maintenance responsibilities 19 16 Would rather spend money on other things 13 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Source: New Home Trends Institute by John Burns Real Estate Consulting LLC.

While demand for rental housing is unexpectedly high, conversely, construction completion figures must be assumed to be falling instead of rising. Higher interest rates and construction costs have made projects massively more expensive. Expected sales prices, on the other hand, have fallen. This has led to a halt in many construction projects. Instead of 400,000 completed flats per year, as targeted by the federal government, a figure 200,000 new flats in 2023 seems much more likely. In 2024, it is likely to be even lower. The supply-demand relationship is thus out of balance as rarely before . In the next few years, we therefore expect the already very low vacancy rates in most rental housing markets to fall further and rents to rise. From the landlords point of view, the fundamental framework conditions not only remain favourable, the outlook has even improved compared to last year. However, the socially explosive nature of these developments is likely to call government onto the scene.", "filename": "outlook-real-estatet-market-germany-dec-2022.pdf"}, {"text": " For many years, we have pointed out in our housing market outlook that these cities are likely to have higher interest rate sensitivity. Now the litmus test is upon us. In addition to the fundamental supply shortage, there are a number of other factors that tend to raise prices. For example, adjusted for inflation, the price decline in 2022 was already very strong. In addition, the very negative real interest rates are currently an incentive to invest. Given the high debt levels in many euro countries, they are likely to remain structurally low, probably negative. In this case, borrowers can let inflation work for them, which means they have to pay back less purchasing power than they have borrowed. Another factor is inflation protection. In periods of high inflation, house and apartment prices increased faster than inflation. This is likely to be the case this time as well, especially against the backdrop of the high supply shortage. Last but not least, rents are starting to pick up. Admittedly, the strict regulatory environment argues against strong rent increases.", "filename": "2023_Housing_market_outlook__Price_dip_and_interes.pdf"}, {"text": " So far, migra- tion from the highest-priced markets has not been enough to actually reduce housing costs in those markets, though costs generally are rising more slowly there. Demographics and the slowing economy could also help ease the housing imbalance. The nations population is growing at its slowest pace ever, thanks to both low birth and immigration rates. And fewer buyers are on the hunt for homes now due to affordability and concerns about possible job losses in a recession. The good news is that it is an opportunity for home- builders and land developers to do a little catch-up. Theyve been running behind for two years, and they may actually welcome a little respite to finish the homes that they have sold, thinks a senior adviser to many homebuilders.

So, a number of important topics for us and investors to consider. We hope you find our answers insightful and useful in determining your strategy and thinking about some of the key questions in real estate as we move into the new year. Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy. Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs.", "filename": "global-real-estate-markets-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " Interest in newer homes and those that have been retrofitted to be more energy-efficient is likely to be higher than in the past, in spite of higher cold rents.

In an August 2022 survey by the National Association of Business Economics, only a quarter of economists were even somewhat confident that the Fed could bring down inflation to its target range without causing a recession.

Europe faces especially severe challenges stemming from an energy price shock, with ripple effects of unknown global scope. The dominant driver of inflation in the US, Canada and Singapore is that their economies are robust and operating close to full capacity. Demand- led inflation is relatively benign compared to inflation from a supply shock, but the central banks in these countries must still raise interest rates, either to manage their domestic economic situations or because their monetary policies are linked to the US Federal Reserve .

So, a number of important topics for us and investors to consider. We hope you find our answers insightful and useful in determining your strategy and thinking about some of the key questions in real estate as we move into the new year. Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy. Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs.", "filename": "global-real-estate-markets-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " But while the changing environment in 2022 has been a shock for some, the long-term outlook is positive, since the fundamental underpinnings of the Canadian property market remain strong. This is why now is the time to invest in solutions to create value beyond the short-term uncertainty. concern previously was about too much capital creating even more competition for deals and pushing up prices for assets, the opposite is true now due in large part to a succession of interest rate increases by the Bank of Canada. Lenders, according to interviewees, have been tightening bor- rowing requirements that, coming on top of higher financing costs, are making it harder for real estate companies to raise capital and move projects forward. This, in turn, is leading to reduced competition for deals during a period of price discov- ery as sellers and buyers find themselves at odds over pricing expectations and valuations as some real estate assets come under pressure.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " N O R T H A M E R I CA The US and Canadian economies and real estate markets are dealing with the global challenges of high inflation, higher interest rates and dimming economic growth outlooks in similar ways. Both also enter 2023 with economies that are still growing and real estate fundamentals largely in balance. There are challenges, but the medium- to long-term outlook remains brighter than the outlook for the near-term. Real estate investors need strategies that are resilient to an expected volatile environment in 2023 and take advantage of the opportunities emerging from volatility. Stubbornly high inflation The root cause of market challenges heading into 2023 is elevated inflation. The US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada have both made lowering inflation their top priority, but it remains stubbornly high in both markets. This led to policy rates increasing from effectively zero to over four percent by year end. The increase in policy rates has been mirrored in long-term rates and in real estate borrowing rates.", "filename": "isa-outlook-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " The resultant rise in the cost of debt and the tightening spread between average real estate yields and the risk-free rate will lead to asset repricing, potentially generating opportunities for non-leveraged investors, who may be better placed than leveraged buyers with refinancing commitments.

In addition, lenders may become more averse to lodging assets in drive-to leisure destinations and more enthusiastic about assets in traditional gateway markets, if group and individual business travel continues to increase. Borrowers with a proven track record in hotel investment, as well as strong lender relationships, will have a competitive edge. The impacts of climate change are becoming increasingly more apparent with the increased rate of natural disasters, flooding, and abnormal weather patterns.

Now the litmus test is upon us. In addition to the fundamental supply shortage, there are a number of other factors that tend to raise prices. For example, adjusted for inflation, the price decline in 2022 was already very strong. In addition, the very negative real interest rates are currently an incentive to invest. Given the high debt levels in many euro countries, they are likely to remain structurally low, probably negative. In this case, borrowers can let inflation work for them, which means they have to pay back less purchasing power than they have borrowed. Another factor is inflation protection. In periods of high inflation, house and apartment prices increased faster than inflation. This is likely to be the case this time as well, especially against the backdrop of the high supply shortage.

By contrast, Europes real estate yield starting point was exceptionally low and market interest rates have moved up much more markedly, making the math that much more impactful. Government policy also matters. As central banks seek to choke off inflation by tightening monetary policy, there is at least the reasonable expectation that some of that inflation will be passed into rents and thus property cash flows. But when governments employ long-term borrowing to bail out energy consumers in the short term, as is necessary in Europe, interest rates are pushed up further and the impact on property values may be more detrimental. As the UKs recent experience would suggest, credit markets can react swiftly to reflect changes in perceived debt sustainability.

Reflecting the view of several CRE leaders we interviewed, a senior executive with a global devel- opment and investment firm said, My gut says were going to have a recession, but its going to be relatively mild compared to some of the more severe recessions weve had.

It was a speculative question, with the underlying assumption that rate increases thus far had not yet impacted values. Regardless of the answer then, it became very clear in 2022 that the relentless math of higher borrowing rates was having an impact on leveraged returns and asset values . The boost investors were getting from borrowing has shifted to a drag on a cash basis, but with unleveraged internal rates of return generally above borrowing rates, leverage is still marginally accretive on a total return basis. However, with less lift from borrowing, leveraged buyers are largely out of the market . Higher borrowing rates are a function of both higher indices and increased borrowing spreads. Lending volume is down significantly and lenders are becoming more conservative.

So, a number of important topics for us and investors to consider. We hope you find our answers insightful and useful in determining your strategy and thinking about some of the key questions in real estate as we move into the new year. Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy. Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs.", "filename": "global-real-estate-markets-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " In Japan, debt costs have moved far less than in other parts of the world, as inflation remains subdued and the Bank of Japan continues to exercise yield curve control . By contrast, Europes real estate yield starting point was exceptionally low and market interest rates have moved up much more markedly, making the math that much more impactful. Government policy also matters. As central banks seek to choke off inflation by tightening monetary policy, there is at least the reasonable expectation that some of that inflation will be passed into rents and thus property cash flows. But when governments employ long-term borrowing to bail out energy consumers in the short term, as is necessary in Europe, interest rates are pushed up further and the impact on property values may be more detrimental. As the UKs recent experience would suggest, credit markets can react swiftly to reflect changes in perceived debt sustainability.

The Feds implementation of tighter monetary policy has prompted lenders to adjust rates and widen spreads. With speculation of an impending recession, debt availability has become limited and heavily dependent on characteristics specific to both the asset and the borrower. In addition, lenders may become more averse to lodging assets in drive-to leisure destinations and more enthusiastic about assets in traditional gateway markets, if group and individual business travel continues to increase. Borrowers with a proven track record in hotel investment, as well as strong lender relationships, will have a competitive edge. The impacts of climate change are becoming increasingly more apparent with the increased rate of natural disasters, flooding, and abnormal weather patterns. As a result, insurance premi- ums have risen in regions with high risk. These premiums have been more heavily factored into underwriting, affecting both debt and equity investment decisions in locations where these higher risks exist.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " The resultant rise in the cost of debt and the tightening spread between average real estate yields and the risk-free rate will lead to asset repricing, potentially generating opportunities for non-leveraged investors, who may be better placed than leveraged buyers with refinancing commitments.

Our expectation is that transaction activity will be below average in 2023, but start to recover in some sectors later in the year. While unleveraged buyers are not directly impacted by higher interest rates, they are also shifting their pricing and buying activity. They are adjusting their cost of capital in response to the broader capital markets, and unleveraged or low-leverage buyers are capital constrained as well. Higher interest rates have hurt the value of investors broader investment portfolios, triggering the so-called denominator effect, contributing to less competitive and less aggressive pricing for real estate.

Persistently high inflation, which suggests interest rate hikes, increasing macroprudential risks in the short term. We expect the interest rate peak later this year. This could be the starting signal for higher prices again. Politically and socially, CO2 emissions from buildings are increasingly coming into focus. In recent quarters, prices have already diverged between properties with low and high emissions. As the supply of energy-efficient buildings is likely to remain scarce, but demand is rising due to both regulatory requirements and increasing social significance, we expect even greater price divergence in the long term. 2023 Housing market outlook vdp Residential property price indices 1 2003100 1.", "filename": "2023_Housing_market_outlook__Price_dip_and_interes.pdf"}, {"text": " For many years, we have pointed out in our housing market outlook that these cities are likely to have higher interest rate sensitivity. Now the litmus test is upon us. In addition to the fundamental supply shortage, there are a number of other factors that tend to raise prices. For example, adjusted for inflation, the price decline in 2022 was already very strong. In addition, the very negative real interest rates are currently an incentive to invest. Given the high debt levels in many euro countries, they are likely to remain structurally low, probably negative. In this case, borrowers can let inflation work for them, which means they have to pay back less purchasing power than they have borrowed. Another factor is inflation protection. In periods of high inflation, house and apartment prices increased faster than inflation. This is likely to be the case this time as well, especially against the backdrop of the high supply shortage.

The following consequences are likely to result from an environment with structurally high inflation, a tendency toward somewhat higher nominal interest rates and negative real interest rates. First, prices will probably remain under pressure until the end of the interest rate hikes. Second, highly leveraged projects are significantly riskier than in the past decade, which should put the brakes on risk-taking investors. This scenario would therefore continue to allow risk-averse, long-term investors to achieve decent returns. 4.5 Risk scenario for 2023 and later: Structurally high inflation There are two main reasons why inflation could continue to spike upward. First, tax revenues bubble up when inflation rates are high.

This is all the more true as the labor market is extremely robust. Loan defaults are therefore likely to increase only slightly at most.

Accordingly, long-term benchmark interest rates such as 10-year Bund yields are also relevant for mortgage loans. In the course of 2023, in the absence of further supply shocks, the high energy and commodity prices of 2022 will have a diminishing impact on inflation.

Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy. Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs.", "filename": "global-real-estate-markets-2023.pdf"}, {"text": "5 Spiking rates drive rapid tightening of financial conditions Cost of capital rising sharply in most geographies Nominal corporate bond yields 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 7 0 n a J 8 0 n a J 9 0 n a J 0 1 n a J 1 1 n a J 2 1 n a J 3 1 n a J 4 1 n a J 5 1 n a J 6 1 n a J 7 1 n a J 8 1 n a J 9 1 n a J 0 2 n a J 1 2 n a J 2 2 n a J US C.

It was a speculative question, with the underlying assumption that rate increases thus far had not yet impacted values. Regardless of the answer then, it became very clear in 2022 that the relentless math of higher borrowing rates was having an impact on leveraged returns and asset values . The boost investors were getting from borrowing has shifted to a drag on a cash basis, but with unleveraged internal rates of return generally above borrowing rates, leverage is still marginally accretive on a total return basis. However, with less lift from borrowing, leveraged buyers are largely out of the market . Higher borrowing rates are a function of both higher indices and increased borrowing spreads. Lending volume is down significantly and lenders are becoming more conservative. The supply of debt capital from large money center banks is down due to large positions taken in the first half of 2022 coupled with stress testing.", "filename": "isa-outlook-2023.pdf"}, {"text": "98 3.66 2.89 3.67 2.73 3.40 2023 2022 1 2 Large decline 3 Stay the same 4 5 Large increase Source: Emerging Trends in Real Estate surveys.

And suddenly, things didnt pencil, and that generated broken deals. The cost of financing for real estate and everything else went up dramatically. And so everything has to be repriced, everything has to be reset. Also limiting investor demand: debt is getting more difficult to obtain, and the Emerging Trends survey expects underwriting standards to get even more rigorous.

Now the litmus test is upon us. In addition to the fundamental supply shortage, there are a number of other factors that tend to raise prices. For example, adjusted for inflation, the price decline in 2022 was already very strong. In addition, the very negative real interest rates are currently an incentive to invest. Given the high debt levels in many euro countries, they are likely to remain structurally low, probably negative. In this case, borrowers can let inflation work for them, which means they have to pay back less purchasing power than they have borrowed. Another factor is inflation protection. In periods of high inflation, house and apartment prices increased faster than inflation. This is likely to be the case this time as well, especially against the backdrop of the high supply shortage. Last but not least, rents are starting to pick up. Admittedly, the strict regulatory environment argues against strong rent increases.", "filename": "2023_Housing_market_outlook__Price_dip_and_interes.pdf"}, {"text": " The big unknown is how much demand this supply will be matched by. In principle, many investment managers and other capital collection agencies still have plenty of money to invest, and capital sources such as insurance companies and pension institutions are continuously receiving more money to invest. However, the trend in recent years of more and more of this money flowing into the real estate markets may have been broken with the turnaround in interest rates. The artificially low interest rates have made the money and bond market unattractive for many years. In addition, central banks have squeezed private investors out of the market with their securities purchase programmes and forced them to invest their money elsewhere, including in real estate. If this period now comes to an end, it could result in a countervailing reallocation process. In combination with monetary tightening, there would then be less money available for real estate investments than before until the long-term growth trend gains the upper hand again. From a German perspective, there is another question: how safe is Germany still perceived as an investment haven? For the moment, we believe we can observe that overseas investors at least have become more cautious.", "filename": "outlook-real-estatet-market-germany-dec-2022.pdf"}, {"text": " N O R T H A M E R I CA The US and Canadian economies and real estate markets are dealing with the global challenges of high inflation, higher interest rates and dimming economic growth outlooks in similar ways. Both also enter 2023 with economies that are still growing and real estate fundamentals largely in balance. There are challenges, but the medium- to long-term outlook remains brighter than the outlook for the near-term. Real estate investors need strategies that are resilient to an expected volatile environment in 2023 and take advantage of the opportunities emerging from volatility. Stubbornly high inflation The root cause of market challenges heading into 2023 is elevated inflation. The US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada have both made lowering inflation their top priority, but it remains stubbornly high in both markets. This led to policy rates increasing from effectively zero to over four percent by year end. The increase in policy rates has been mirrored in long-term rates and in real estate borrowing rates.", "filename": "isa-outlook-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " These conditions would be problematic for property markets: slowing or falling economic growth dampens tenant demand, while higher interest rates raise the cost of developing or acquiring properties. Both factors would cut returns and reduce values. Indeed, rising interest rates and uncertainty over future market conditions are already killing deals since sellers have not been ready to capitulate to buyers growing demands for price concessions, as we discuss in our capital markets trend. New Horizons Still, not all recessions are alike, and most economists, as well as Emerging Trends interviewees, expect any recession to be relatively short and shallow. Reflecting the view of several CRE leaders we interviewed, a senior executive with a global devel- opment and investment firm said, My gut says were going to have a recession, but its going to be relatively mild compared to some of the more severe recessions weve had. I dont see anything like the 2008 economic downturn going on. One leading CRE economist went so far as to say, I think were going into what I would say is a healthy down cycle.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " Meanwhile, the same interest rate increases that reduce lever- aged returns and thus demand for real estate also make bonds and other interest-bearing investments more compelling. As the head of real estate banking at one investment bank explains, Rising bond yields are going to mean that real estate and other alternatives are all going to be facing less availability of capital and some outflows. And while interest rates are increasing, equity and bond prices have been falling, triggering the denominator effect for some institutional investors with asset allocations that must remain in balance. The denominator effect can be magnified because CRE values in a portfolio are generally appraisal-based, which tend to be backward-looking. However, the impact on CRE portfolios may not be severe this time. Many institutional investors have been under-allocated in CRE, so they will not need to rebalance by selling real estate assets.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " In Japan, debt costs have moved far less than in other parts of the world, as inflation remains subdued and the Bank of Japan continues to exercise yield curve control . By contrast, Europes real estate yield starting point was exceptionally low and market interest rates have moved up much more markedly, making the math that much more impactful. Government policy also matters. As central banks seek to choke off inflation by tightening monetary policy, there is at least the reasonable expectation that some of that inflation will be passed into rents and thus property cash flows. But when governments employ long-term borrowing to bail out energy consumers in the short term, as is necessary in Europe, interest rates are pushed up further and the impact on property values may be more detrimental. As the UKs recent experience would suggest, credit markets can react swiftly to reflect changes in perceived debt sustainability.

This is why now is the time to invest in solutions to create value beyond the short-term uncertainty. concern previously was about too much capital creating even more competition for deals and pushing up prices for assets, the opposite is true now due in large part to a succession of interest rate increases by the Bank of Canada. Lenders, according to interviewees, have been tightening bor- rowing requirements that, coming on top of higher financing costs, are making it harder for real estate companies to raise capital and move projects forward. This, in turn, is leading to reduced competition for deals during a period of price discov- ery as sellers and buyers find themselves at odds over pricing expectations and valuations as some real estate assets come under pressure.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " Prospective: In the year 2025 The lessons of the early 1990s are clear: real estate down-cycles do not last forever. Reflecting on the frightening memories of plummeting values, empty buildings, bankruptcies and the Resolution Trust Corporation , suggests that the current round of credit tightening is likely to pale in comparison. The 2023 edition of LaSalles ISA Outlook anticipates the impacts of the rising cost of credit, a stall in economic growth and a pause in the multi-decade pattern of real estate appreciation. However, it does not extrapolate these trends far into the future. The human tendency to latch onto a few pieces of information and to expect that a narrow set of recent facts will shape future events is known as anchoring bias. When investing in a long-duration asset class like real estate, a longer-term, holistic view is more valuable.

Ultimately, however, valuations are the result of the interaction between higher debt costs and the path of real estate fundamentals, the prospects for which vary widely across sectors and geographies. Tracing back real estate cash flows to their drivers is to follow a chain of causation back to basic variables like population, GDP, industrial production, consumer spending and employment.

Moderating inflation rates this summer led many to believe that the worst was over and that the Fed could soon ease up its con- tractionary monetary policy.

So, a number of important topics for us and investors to consider. We hope you find our answers insightful and useful in determining your strategy and thinking about some of the key questions in real estate as we move into the new year. Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy. Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs.", "filename": "global-real-estate-markets-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " For many years, we have pointed out in our housing market outlook that these cities are likely to have higher interest rate sensitivity. Now the litmus test is upon us. In addition to the fundamental supply shortage, there are a number of other factors that tend to raise prices. For example, adjusted for inflation, the price decline in 2022 was already very strong. In addition, the very negative real interest rates are currently an incentive to invest. Given the high debt levels in many euro countries, they are likely to remain structurally low, probably negative. In this case, borrowers can let inflation work for them, which means they have to pay back less purchasing power than they have borrowed. Another factor is inflation protection. In periods of high inflation, house and apartment prices increased faster than inflation. This is likely to be the case this time as well, especially against the backdrop of the high supply shortage.

It was a speculative question, with the underlying assumption that rate increases thus far had not yet impacted values. Regardless of the answer then, it became very clear in 2022 that the relentless math of higher borrowing rates was having an impact on leveraged returns and asset values . The boost investors were getting from borrowing has shifted to a drag on a cash basis, but with unleveraged internal rates of return generally above borrowing rates, leverage is still marginally accretive on a total return basis. However, with less lift from borrowing, leveraged buyers are largely out of the market . Higher borrowing rates are a function of both higher indices and increased borrowing spreads.

While unleveraged buyers are not directly impacted by higher interest rates, they are also shifting their pricing and buying activity. They are adjusting their cost of capital in response to the broader capital markets, and unleveraged or low-leverage buyers are capital constrained as well.

But finally, we are seeing signs that upward inflationary pressures are moderating and some indicators are showing disinflation. Commodity prices are down in recent months, supply chain pressures are easing, inventories are rising and the pace of wage increases is less than recent inflation rates. In the real estate realm, home prices are falling and the pace of residential rental rate increases has slowed.

Higher interest rates and construction costs have made projects massively more expensive. Expected sales prices, on the other hand, have fallen. This has led to a halt in many construction projects. Instead of 400,000 completed flats per year, as targeted by the federal government, a figure 200,000 new flats in 2023 seems much more likely. In 2024, it is likely to be even lower. The supply-demand relationship is thus out of balance as rarely before . In the next few years, we therefore expect the already very low vacancy rates in most rental housing markets to fall further and rents to rise.

In 2023, according to our calculations, 59 of the 126 cities have higher demand than supply. The situation improves only slowly over the decade, according to our projections. In 2030, 35 cities still have a supply shortage. These are mainly the cities with high populations. The shortages are also likely to radiate to their neighbouring cities and entire regions. However, there are significant differences. The metropolitan areas with a high supply shortage over the entire decade include Berlin, Frankfurt, Hanover, Heidelberg, Cologne, Leipzig, Stuttgart, and Munich. According to our calculations, the supply shortage will end in 2025 in Dsseldorf and Hamburg, while the market has eased in Bremen and Nuremberg.", "filename": "2023_Housing_market_outlook__Price_dip_and_interes.pdf"}, {"text": " Logistics markets Private households and the manufacturing sector are suffering particularly from the current and foreseeable macroeconomic environment. The former are facing a massive real loss of purchasing power due to high inflation and will have to reduce their consumption. The latter will be squeezed by rising energy costs and lower global demand. If fewer goods are bought as well as produced, this puts a double burden on the demand for logistics space. After rising to record levels until recently, take-up is expected to fall in 2023. A rising number of insolvencies, especially among small and medium-sized enterprises, could also lead to higher vacancy rates in the small-space segment. In addition, online retail, which was a massive demand driver especially in the last two years, is experiencing a setback. This was to be expected anyway after the pandemic- related boom. It is now being exacerbated by high inflation. Such an effect could also be observed with regard to inventories.

However, we think it unlikely that the existing equity volume will be sufficient to anchor prices below the cost of financing. The fact that the increase in initial yields is nevertheless likely to be comparatively flat is also due to the mostly comfortable financing situation on the part of the landlords. Apart from the project development segment, we expect few forced sales. We rule out a wave of non-performing loans like after the financial crisis.

Regardless of the answer then, it became very clear in 2022 that the relentless math of higher borrowing rates was having an impact on leveraged returns and asset values . The boost investors were getting from borrowing has shifted to a drag on a cash basis, but with unleveraged internal rates of return generally above borrowing rates, leverage is still marginally accretive on a total return basis. However, with less lift from borrowing, leveraged buyers are largely out of the market . Higher borrowing rates are a function of both higher indices and increased borrowing spreads.

While unleveraged buyers are not directly impacted by higher interest rates, they are also shifting their pricing and buying activity. They are adjusting their cost of capital in response to the broader capital markets, and unleveraged or low-leverage buyers are capital constrained as well. Higher interest rates have hurt the value of investors broader investment portfolios, triggering the so-called denominator effect, contributing to less competitive and less aggressive pricing for real estate.

With the normalisation of monetary policy that has now begun, this situation should dissolve and the rise in real estate yields should be flatter than that of the risk-free interest rate. As a look at the early 1990s shows, prime real estate yields can even be below bond yields. Such a constellation presupposes high rental growth expectations. Given the current macro environment, we believe that investor expectations of rental growth are not sufficiently high for this in any sector.

Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy. Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process.

In principle, many investment managers and other capital collection agencies still have plenty of money to invest, and capital sources such as insurance companies and pension institutions are continuously receiving more money to invest. However, the trend in recent years of more and more of this money flowing into the real estate markets may have been broken with the turnaround in interest rates. The artificially low interest rates have made the money and bond market unattractive for many years. In addition, central banks have squeezed private investors out of the market with their securities purchase programmes and forced them to invest their money elsewhere, including in real estate. If this period now comes to an end, it could result in a countervailing reallocation process.

Perhaps the biggest surprise is that these reversals of fortune are hitting favored property sectors like multifamily and indus- trial.

Government policy also matters. As central banks seek to choke off inflation by tightening monetary policy, there is at least the reasonable expectation that some of that inflation will be passed into rents and thus property cash flows. But when governments employ long-term borrowing to bail out energy consumers in the short term, as is necessary in Europe, interest rates are pushed up further and the impact on property values may be more detrimental.
