Those characteristics are still in place, and market sentiment toward offices has also changed as the risks are more broadly recognized. Lenders are materially raising spreads and limiting loan proceeds. Moreover, there are few active core buyers, as most have substantial office allocations and have a dim view of the risk-return outlook for the office sector. These factors should lead to equity losses for many office owners and the expected emergence of distressed transactions. We expect office demand to recover slowly, as obsolete buildings are removed due to conversion of use or demolition. Fundamentals and rents will eventually recover, but that is likely years away.

We are reluctant to make investment decisions based solely on a view of future interest rates, but acknowledge that real estate pricing is linked to future interest rates. Given this dynamic, we recommend investors consider a range of interest rate scenarios . Interest rate increases and the relentless math Each time interest rates ticked higher since the GFC, the question of when higher debt costs would impact real estate values was asked. It was a speculative question, with the underlying assumption that rate increases thus far had not yet impacted values. Regardless of the answer then, it became very clear in 2022 that the relentless math of higher borrowing rates was having an impact on leveraged returns and asset values . The boost investors were getting from borrowing has shifted to a drag on a cash basis, but with unleveraged internal rates of return generally above borrowing rates, leverage is still marginally accretive on a total return basis. However, with less lift from borrowing, leveraged buyers are largely out of the market . Higher borrowing rates are a function of both higher indices and increased borrowing spreads. Lending volume is down significantly and lenders are becoming more conservative. The supply of debt capital from large money center banks is down due to large positions taken in the first half of 2022 coupled with stress testing. The Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (CMBS) market continues to be impacted by volatility and life companies are looking into 2023 until fresh allocations become available.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2023_Housing_market_outlook__Price_dip_and_interes.pdf-!33: 75 after three 25 basis point hikes in May, June, and July.

In simplified terms, this is the motivation driving the booming Life Sciences sector of the economy, which is resear- ching corresponding solutions. However, classic office premises are not appropriate for companies in this segment. Although office space is required for administrative and management functions, the main focus is on laboratory space used by the biolo- gists, chemists and medical staff who are carrying out the research. This combinati- on - the young lab offices segment - is of increasing interest to investors. What lies behind the lab office trend and what potential does it have? The Covid pandemic is a starting point for a review of this segment. It has not only shifted vaccine development into the public focus, but has also brought into the mainstream concepts such as vulnerable and pre-existing conditions to refer to people at risk of serious cases of Covid 19. Because people are living longer thanks to medical progress, these concepts apply to large sections of the population and not just to a small number of people. In 2021 in Germany more than one fifth of the po- pulation  around 18 million people  had reached the age of 65. However, increa- sed life expectancy has not so far been accompanied by improved fitness levels. In fact the opposite is true. A sedentary lifestyle, high-calorie food, ready meals contai- ning a lot of sugar, and the consumption of alcohol and tobacco have consequences, and considerably increase the risk of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, demen- tia, heart attacks, cancer and strokes. The growing number of older people suffering ill health is also a significant economic factor.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!10:  After all, large and growing sections of the populations of the affluent countries of Asia, Europe and North America suffer from these diseases. The willingness and ability to invest large amounts of money in maintaining health is therefore correspondingly strong. An ever increasing number of people worldwide al- so have access to medical care. Life Sciences essentially consist of a combination of various scientific disciplines such as biology, chemistry, medicine and pharmaceuticals. In turn, the main activity of the biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and medical technology segments in focus he- re is research into living organisms. Life Sciences are associated with the develop- ment of economically successful products for human health rather than with funda- mental research. In Germany, biotechnology moved centre stage and gained additi- onal momentum with the approval of the first Covid vaccine. However, the path to producing a market-ready substance is long and fraught with obstacles. Only a fraction of the substances researched are actually successful. To achieve rapid progress, sufficiently large teams are needed. Growth in the number of jobs in Life Sciences is leading to correspondingly higher demand for properties and investment. According to estimates, more than 300,000 people in more than 2,000 companies are employed in the Life Sciences sector in Germany. Biotechnology is the smallest segment, while pharmaceuticals and medical technology employ signifi- cantly more people. The functions of the properties required range from pure offices via laboratories and pharmaceutical logistics to production plants. From our perspec- tive, this combination of office and laboratory  the lab office  is of particular interest to investors.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!4:  The process of voting legitimizes leaders and keeps them somewhat accountable, yet their manipulation of the electorate and ability to control policy severely limits their capacity to serve all people fairly once they gain power. Schumpeters viewpoints were shaped by being an escapee of both the rise of fascism in 1930s Germany and of Soviet-style communism of the 1950sregimes that came to power through sham elections. Like the 2525 video, reading Schumpeter reminds us how the past, present and future all intersect. Geopolitical events in LaSalles target countries are as difficult to predict as the idiosyncratic motivations of their leaders. As researchers, we cannot know the future, but we can help devise strategies to cope with whatever alternative futures may arise. The forces of nationalism, authoritarianism and a distrust of globalism may represent a temporary triumph of politics over economics. Over the long term, though, the power of open markets remains a force to be reckoned with and not to be underestimated. Likewise, well-constructed and well-located properties can thrive even during periods of great political turmoil. Successful real estate investing rests on identification of timeless attributes that are successful over the course of several cycles. These attributes must be appropriately priced and they must also adapt to trends in demographics, technology, urbanization and environmental factors. This triangle of timelessness, adaptation and fair value pricing forms the foundation for successful real estate investing. As I hand over the reins of LaSalles research to a new generation of researchers, I sense that the past, present and future will continue to intersect and to overlap. The awarding of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Economics was based in part on an analysis of the Great Depression of the 1930s. We have learned much about credit cycles and the role of banks in maintaining or losing confidence in market institutions. At the same time, the events of 2022 in Ukraine and elsewhere show how unpredictable the course of human events can be.

The seeds of growth begin with the research and development activities happening in innovative life-sciences market clusters, where science, technology, institutional support, and funding all meet to drive progress. The most mature market clusters are generating the great- est level of demand and investment activity, but expansion into emerging markets is starting to take firmer hold. As institutions, universities, and local communities invest in the development of innovation communities, talent pipelines, and incubator space for growing startups, more markets will capture the growth of the life-sciences industry. Top clusters have evolved over several decades, but emerg- ing markets planting the seeds of industry infrastructure today will see the benefit over the long term. The convergence of science and technology is happening within innovation com- munities across markets, with pockets of growth emerging in Houston, Boulder, Atlanta, and Dallas, among others. The long-term view on the life-sciences sector is quite posi- tive. The advances in science, the continued flow of capital, and the development of ecosystems in markets outside the core clusters will bolster the industrys steady expansion over the long term. Life Sciences Is a Resilient Long-Term Opportunity Innovation is happening at a more rapid pace than ever before, opening up limitless possibilities for the advance- ment of medical and life sciences.

The ultimate impact of WFH on office demand is likely to fall somewhere between the extreme estimates, varying by location and property quality. Demand will be strong in growing markets with rapid job growth, and for A-quality assets. BC-quality assets will see the biggest drop in occupancy and rents. Asking rent growth will remain weak, and expenses will continue to rise, so net income growth will turn negative in properties that are dated or in need of capital improvements.

And the homes that do get built are expensive, particularly since the pandemic. Construction costs shot up due to supply chain disruptions and are still worrisome. As one housing industry adviser notes, Theres a stress index about global supply chains, and those stress indices are all indicating that theyre moderating, but theyre still at very high levels. Finally, high permitting fees and utility charges and large minimum lot sizes push developers to build more expensive homes. Renters Priced Out of the Homebuying Market With a growing share of households priced out of the for-sale market, demand for rental units is far outstripping new supply. Though population growth slowed sharply during the pandemic, demand is also rising from the many young adults eager to start their own households after moving back in with their parents during COVID. Further boosting demand is the increasing number of younger adults choosing to live alone, according The multifamily sector has responded with an unprecedented increase in new supply. Weve built more multifamily housing units over the last 10 years than we had in any other time since 1980, notes an adviser to institutional investors. But it is still far less than needed. Vacancies have fallen to their lowest levels ever while rents are rising faster than evereven faster than home prices. And though not a formal part of the affordability calculations, other housing-related costs like utilities and main- tenance are also rising faster than incomes, further constraining the ability of households to afford basic shelter. Moving to More Affordable Recent slowdowns in rent growth and home price appreciation, noted in our Normalizing trend, have done little to increase affordability. So how to address this? Millions of people have taken matters into their own hands.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!24:  dollar, while its going up, also confirms that foreigners like to own U.

Too Much for Too Many  Housing affordability has fallen to its lowest level in over 30 years. Prices and rents have soared relative to incomes. Spiraling mortgage rates have pushed the homeownership bar further out of reach for a growing share of households.  The chronic undersupply of housing is the result of govern- ment policies that limit new supply or increase construction costs and is exacerbated by a labor shortage, as well as NIMBYism.  Simply constructing more housing may be the most obvious and effective solution, but is far from easy to achieve. Housing is too expensive. It has been that way for too longfor too many people neither for-sale nor rental housing is afford- ablebut prices and rents have soared even further out of reach over the course of the past year. And even if we experi- ence an economic downturn, as many economists expect, it is not projected to provide significant relief. It starts with record home prices. The U. S. median existing- home price jumped by over 18 percent in 2021 alonethe largest increase on record going back to the early 1950s and then tacked on a further 15 percent through mid-2022. Combined with rapidly rising mortgage rates, housing afford- ability has fallen to its lowest level in over 30 years relative to incomes, according to the National Association of Realtors.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!126:  The failure to adequately expand the regional infrastructure was a problem identified by local experts we interviewed and an impediment to future growth. 75 Housing affordability is another constraint on growth. For-sale housing is now less affordable than the national average in the three market subgroups experienc- ing the most significant decline in ratings this year, including the Supernova markets, while rental housing is also less affordable than average in two of the three groupings. That is, a lower share of the local population can afford the median-priced home, whether for-sale or rental. Ironically, the affordability challenges extend to a subgroup we call the Affordable West. These markets are, indeed, more affordable than the ultra-pricey West Coast markets, especially those in California. But population growth has outpaced hous- ing development, pushing up home prices faster than local incomes. Much of the population growth in these markets has been fueled by the in-migration of households seeking more affordable housing, suggesting that growth could soon slow in some of these markets, absent an easing in home prices. On the other hand, the three market subgroups that experi- enced the greatest relative rating improvements over the last year all have relatively affordable housing . This includes the large Super Sun Belt group, comprising markets such as Houston, Atlanta, and DallasFort Worth. Though the cost of doing business in some of these metro areas has been rising, investors like the combination of housing affordability and strong population and economic growth. Also gaining strongly this year are the highly affordable Eds and Meds markets. Six of the eight markets in this subgroup improved their relative ratingwith Memphis and Pittsburgh each rising more than 10 placesand only one market fell modestly. The situation is the opposite in many of the Establishment mar- kets, which suffer from not only expensive housing but also high costs of doing business, in addition to slower growth. Continuing a longstanding Emerging Trends pattern, interest in the gateway markets is muted. Only three of the eight most expensive coastal markets rank among the top 20. This represents a significant comedown from a decade ago when these markets accounted for seven of the top 10 Emerging Trends markets.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!177: 4 percent in 20202021 from 0.5 percent in 20012002. We can see the impacts of all these trends on housing afford- ability in places like Halifax. According to the RBCs latest report, the affordability measure for Halifax reached 38.6 per- cent for a single-family detached home, which was well above the long-term average of 31.6 percent for Halifax. 95 Exhibit 4-4 Housing Affordability Vancouver Toronto Canada Ottawa Montreal Calgary Halifax Winnipeg Saskatoon Edmonton Quebec City 1Q 2022 1Q 2021 1Q 2020 1Q 2019 1Q 2018 1Q 2017 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Source: RBC Economics, Housing Trends and Affordability reports, accessed July 21, 2022. Note: The RBC Housing Affordability Measures show the proportion of median pre-tax household income that would be required to cover mortgage payments , property taxes, and utilities based on the benchmark market price for single-family detached homes and condo apartments, as well as for an overall aggregate of all housing types in a given market. 96 Supply Insufficient to Meet Housing Demand The question, of course, becomes what to do about an afford- ability crisis as it spreads across Canada. Even if affordability eventually improves with falling housing prices, the reality is that the key issue underpinning the crisis is insufficient sup- ply to meet high demand for all types of homes. Demand will continue to rise, especially as the Canadian government com- mits to higher immigration targets in the coming years and the country welcomes large numbers of temporary residents, like international students, who also need places to live. This means that even as homebuilding activity has been rising, tight market conditions have put pressures on affordability that are unlikely to ease significantly. As we noted, some interviewees are looking at pausing housing developmentsoften condo projectsas they deal with cost and financing challenges as well as soften- ing demand due to rising interest rates.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, there has been a recent decline in housing affordability, impacting households in their early and middle stages of their careers.

Geopolitical events in LaSalles target countries are as difficult to predict as the idiosyncratic motivations of their leaders.

Likewise, well-constructed and well-located properties can thrive even during periods of great political turmoil. Successful real estate investing rests on identification of timeless attributes that are successful over the course of several cycles.

The Importance of Older Buildings In her classic 1961 urban planning treatise, The Death and Life of Great American Cities, Jane Jacobs elucidates the critical ingredients for a diverse, vibrant city. Among them is one rule that may seem puzzling at first: The district must mingle build- ings that vary in age and condition, including a good proportion of old ones. Why the need for old buildings? Why not all new? If a city area has only new buildings, the enterprises that can exist there are automatically limited to those that can support the high costs of new construction. How boring and monotonous that would be. Jacobs points to all the small local businesses that occupy these older structures that give the neighborhood its diversity and vitality. Although Jacobs doesnt say it precisely, there is another crucial observation regarding the importance of older buildings: so many of them find new life with uses different from their original function. Walk around the bustling old port districts of Montreal or Boston or Portland, Maine, and you will find hundreds of for- mer warehouses that have been repurposed into upscale hotels, cool offices, hip restaurants, and distinctive retail spaces. Conversions are hardly limited to old warehouse districts. Every vibrant downtown is filled with buildings of varying types and vintages that have been converted into new uses. Often the conversions go upstream, as lower-value land uses like ware- houses convert into higher-value uses like office or retail. But the direction is often reversed, with old offices converting into artist space or storage. Lemonade from Lemons Demographic trends and structural demand shifts magnified by the pandemic have rendered countless existing buildings either redundant or obsolete . But manythough not allof these can be either repurposed or upgraded to meet new market standards. The many opportunities include the following: 18  Converting older offices to residential uses, or upgrading them into modern offices, where feasible and supported by the market.  Repurposing excess retail space for other uses or improving with mixed use. And  Scraping buildings to create development land where con- version is not feasible, or where density can be increased, to site new housing.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!45:  The Reconnecting Communities Pilot program may help this project and other similar ones move forward:  The Texas Department of Transportation is building a deck above a sunken portion of I-10 separating downtown and uptown El Paso to create, as described in the federal grant application, amenities such as green space, public gather- ing space, and entertainment venues.  A community group called Loving the Bronx supports capping the Cross-Bronx Expressway, which runs through dense neighborhoods in the South Bronx, with the goals of improving local air quality and providing new land for devel- opment projects.  In Seattle, Lid-5 activists are advocating for the city govern- ment to cover and add green space over I-5.  Reconnect Austin is pushing the city of Austin to bury I-35 through the urban core of Austin and dedicate the new land as public space and developable land.  Many projects of note are either in the works or being actively discussed, including those in Syracuse, New York, Richmond, Virginia. And Houston. Expanding Broadband Access Another program from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law with sig- nificant potential impact on communities and the CRE industry is the $65 billion to expand broadband access to the 30 million Americans living in areas without broadband infrastructure. Recognizing the relatively high cost of service in the United States, the program also seeks to lower prices for internet ser- vice and help close the digital divide, so that more Americans can afford internet access. The importance of this initiative was anticipated in ULIs 2021 report Broadband and Real Estate: Understanding the Opportunity: Availability of widespread, high-speed broadband networks already has a wide variety of benefits to the real estate industry, communities, and individuals. . Increasing mobility opportunities can present potential value that real estate owners and managers can harness for their buildings. Such opportuni- ties include repurposed or reduced parking facilities, denser projects, and higher rates of return. Expanding broadband access to underserved communities is also critical to increasing opportunities for employees in more communities to work from home, as we discussed in our  Still, Weve Changed Some trend above.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!180:  In many communities, fees, charges, and taxes levied by different orders of government make up a very substantial portion of the cost of a new home. In December 2021, for instance, the Building Industry and Land Development Association released a study of the Greater Toronto Area housing market that noted that government-imposed taxes and fees account for as much as 24 percent of the price of a new home. And in some municipalities, plans are in the works to raise this significantly. This includes Toronto, where the city council recently passed a plan to raise residential development charges by 46 percent by 2024. Such actions, along with lengthy development approvals and other municipal policies, only add to homebuilding costs, which, in turn, worsens affordability. Governments also need to prioritize setting aside new land for development as well as more proactive efforts to facilitate the densification of some existing neighborhoods. These are just some of the changes required, but the central theme is a focus on having consistent alignment around increasing supply. And in many cases, that will require provincial policies to ensure consis- tency that has been lacking at the municipal level. How Can the Industry Help? To be sure, the development and broader real estate sectors have a role to play in helping address the crisis. Beyond concerns about societal trust and impacts on the industrys reputation, the issue also increases regulatory risk, especially when it comes to potential policy changes like rent controls and measures targeting investment in the housing market. The industry may have good arguments against such policies, but that does not mean that governments wont introduce them anyway. Many interviewees say that they are ready and eager to help address affordability. As one interviewee told us: We are not the enemy. We are part of the solution. So, what can the industry do? For a few interviewees, there was a recognition of the good years they have been having, with one going as far as sug- gesting that the industry should prepare for a reset of profit expectations.;\n***\n[Submission]: Answer: Yes, the purpose of a constitution is to legitimize leaders and keep them accountable to the people they serve.

Youre going to find people in gen Z and millennials and even gen Xers that have very similar behavioral components and some of that is stage of life, but not all of it is. Consumer-driven trendsa desire for indooroutdoor living, health and well-being features and functionality, designs for a nimble worklife balance at home, holistic home technology solutions for everything from package delivery management, to smart locks, privacy, and security systems, to self-service access to concierge and other community amenitiesare becoming non-negotiable standards as technologies improve. Since COVID, we were able to pivot to a technology footprint for our business model that reduces reliance on people and improves the customer experience, said the CEO of a publicly traded, top-10-ranked multifamily apartment owner-developer. So, it was an acceleration of what weve seen in other sectors to a self-service business model. The core of it is, How do you interact with your customer? and if that gets disrupted or the rules of the road change, How quick can you adapt? Capital Calculus As COVID dynamics shifted multifamily property ownership from individual owners to business and investor enterprises, transaction volumes, multifamily loan originations, and property valuations surged. Yield-thirsty investors greenlighted a boom in new construction, with 420,000 completions estimated for 2022, up from 364,000 in 2021. Wall Street investment giants were raising massive amounts of capital, buying every apartment they could, says the chief executive of a top-10 multifamily real estate investment trust , speaking of the pandemic-era capital pivot into apart- ments. And so, all of a sudden, they became the market themselves. When youre buying apartment portfolios at $20 billion or $30 billion at a clip, youre establishing what the mar- ket floor is. It was, Were going to buy apartments everywhere at a 3.5 or 4 capitalization rate. They didnt differentiate one property from another.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!3:  And 5. Technology, which has expanded every year as proptech applications have revolutionized the management and valuation tools used by practitioners. Prospective: In the year 2025 The lessons of the early 1990s are clear: real estate down-cycles do not last forever. Reflecting on the frightening memories of plummeting values, empty buildings, bankruptcies and the Resolution Trust Corporation , suggests that the current round of credit tightening is likely to pale in comparison. The 2023 edition of LaSalles ISA Outlook anticipates the impacts of the rising cost of credit, a stall in economic growth and a pause in the multi-decade pattern of real estate appreciation. However, it does not extrapolate these trends far into the future. The human tendency to latch onto a few pieces of information and to expect that a narrow set of recent facts will shape future events is known as anchoring bias. When investing in a long-duration asset class like real estate, a longer-term, holistic view is more valuable. In 2014, the apocalyptic visions of German film director, Fritz Langs 1927 masterpiece Metropolis were put alongside the 1960s rock song 2525. The irony of bringing together dark images from one era, while listening to music from another, through the technology of a more recent YouTube artist is symbolic of how imperfectly clever we are at predicting the future. The eerily weird Lang-2525 juxtaposition implicitly illustrates how resilient humanity can be, even while contemplating what seem like existential threats such as fascism, industrialization and robots in the 1920s, nuclear holocausts in the 1960s. Financial panics in the 1990s and again in 2008-2010 and climate change and geopolitical conflict in the 2020s. Josef Schumpeter is most well-remembered for popularizing the term creative destruction. He is less remembered for his work on democratic theory. To Schumpeter, democracy is the mechanism for competition among political parties in a market- like framework.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!68:   Two, demand gathered speed and sweep as people sought larger living spaces to balance remote work and household life, and more outdoor living options.  Three, constrained construction of new supply, and a price run-up on the single-family for-sale front, spilled over into expanded apartment demand.  Lastly, compounding the effects of these four dramatic imbalances came the rocket fuel of a global capital rotation toward de-risked assets . Outsized demand, a sudden spike in remote work mobility, constricted supply, and floods of money with nowhere better to goa grand slam of anomalies. The U. S. apartment property sectorproviding shelter to 37 mil- lion residents in 21.3 million structures of five or more household units, and contributing $3.4 trillion annually to the U. S. economy, according to the NMHCmorphed quickly into an investment asset class pressure cooker. Inflated property valuations, com- pressed cap rates, and a sea change from individual owners to medium and large-sized corporate owners became a new norm seemingly overnight. This time period veers wildly from a steady slope of otherwise well-entrenched trends across the structural demand front. Operational modernization kicked into super-fast-forward mode toward self-service, and a robust new-development pipeline at least. According to a recent Bloomberg report, After dipping in 2020, the number of new units authorized in multifamily build- ings took off, running 37 percent higher over the past 12 months as of June 2022 than in the same period in 20182019. As of August, 862,000 apartments were under construction, up 25 percent from a year ago. At the same time, COVIDs aftermath sharply defined conflicting forceswhich together destine virtually all of Americas newly developed and built apartment communities for a financially privileged professional class. Rather than causing an expansion of rental housing stock, however, higher-income households come-lately demand for rental neighborhoods instead served to crowd out moderate- and lower-income households in supply- constrained areas. Its been virtually impossible to build affordable, says the chief executive of one of the apartment industry trade groups.;\n***\n[Submission]: Answer: Apples are a type of fruit that grow on trees.

Adaptation Key as the Landscape Shifts for Canadian Real Estate What does this mean for real estate companies? For some, it adds further to the need to take a pause on activity. There have been rising projections, for example, of developers delaying or potentially canceling condo projects as it becomes harder to make the numbers work in these challenging conditions. Others are trying to manage this by spacing out advanced sales of new housing units to ensure that prices reflect rising costs as a project moves forward.

While challenging, an environment like this also presents opportu- nities. Companies with less leverage may be able to secure assets at more reasonable prices. And while some sources of financing may be less available than in the past, many interviewees predict that the private debt market will help fill some of the gap. The pause in the market is also a chance to explore solutions to some of the challenges that builders are facing. Some interviewees, for example, touted mass timber as a potential opportunity to get projects built faster, which is key in an environment of rising costs. 2. ESG Performance: A Critical Issue for Canadian Real Estate You can do ESG, and you can get a return. Alternative materials like mass timber also offer important sustainability benefits, which brings us to another critical issue for Canadas real estate industry: ESG performance. There are many factors underpinning the ESG imperative, but a few issues in particular are driving the increased focus for real estate companies now. Key among them is the ability to attract capital.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!46:  In addition, new building could ease off further as construction projects are delayed as they are on the housing front because of a shortage of building materials. New construction projects are also being shelved be- cause of higher financing costs and a sharp rise in the price of materials. Construc- tion costs in the office segment have increased by almost 30 per cent since the end of 2019. Market conditions for the office market The various challenges weighing on the economy have had a major impact on the monthly surveys of economists and companies regarding the current situation and expectations. The financial market experts questioned as part of the ZEW Financial Market Survey see both the current situation and economic expectations deep in negative territory. In contrast, among companies, there is a yawning gap between the current situation and expectations: Whereas companies are still relatively upbeat about the current situation, expectations in the ifo Business Climate Index have vir- tually slumped, pulling the index down overall and leading to an unusually large gap between the current situation and expectations.

New building activity did not start to pick up until 2012 onwards, long after the surge in immigration after the turn of the century. On an aggregated basis across top locations, only around 20,000 homes p. a. were built from 2002 to 2011. Thereafter, completion figures rose to over 50,000 units up until 2018. Rising purchase prices, rental growth and higher investor demand made new builds lucrative. Between 2016 and 2019, building permits for 60,000 flats and more were issued every year, which means that even higher numbers of units could have been built. Instead, however, housing construction has been slowing down again since 2019  falling to around 40,000 units by 2021. Building in towns and cities was hampered by the fact that the construction industry was working more or less at capacity, by a shortage of skilled workers and of materials, along with the emergence of protests here and there. Now though, the construction industry faces much stronger head- wind, and consequently, completion figures are likely to decline further. A shortage of materials is being compounded by a rapid rise in construction costs  above all a huge rise in the price of building materials  along with higher financing costs. A 30- year average shows that the cost of new build flats has increased by a good 3 per cent p. a. The increase in costs in 2018 and 2019 was considerably higher, but since 2021, it has been unprecedented: Construction costs rose by around 9 per cent in 2021 and, in the first half of 2022, they rose by almost 16 per cent! The cost of reno- vation has risen on a similar scale.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!170: 45 4.44 4.43 3.95 3.75 3.59 3.56 3.55 3.55 3.51 3.33 3.23 3.11 2.93 2.91 Source: Emerging Trends in Real Estate 2023 survey. Note: Based on Canadian respondents only. 92 To be sure, the current environment offers relief from the intense bidding competition of recent years, which was also creating challenges for real estate companies. But for now, the height- ened uncertainty is leading many players to stay on the sidelines as they wait to see where the market, particularly when it comes to pricing and valuations, settles. One interviewee noted their cautious approach when they said that they were sticking to the fairway, not trying to clear the trees and skip the dogleg, when it comes to deployment decisions. Cost Escalations amid Supply Chain Challenges and Labor Shortages On top of concerns about the capital markets are supply chain shortages and delays as well as significant increases in costs for labor and materials. Labor issues have been a challenge for some time, but rising costs and shortages of inputs including for key materials like steelhave added to the pressures. According to Statistics Canada, residential building costs were up 22.6 percent on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter of 2022. For nonresidential construction, cost increases were lower but still significant at 12.8 percent. Construction cost increases continued into the second quarter of 2022 amid inflationary pressures throughout the economy. Rising labor shortages are exacerbating the challenges. According to Statistics Canada, construction job vacancies reached a record high in the first quarter of 2022 and were double the number of open positions during the same period in 2020. And then there is the impact of construction wages, which were up 6.6 percent in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2021. All of this has made completing projects on time and on budget even harder than in the past, and the situation is unlikely to improve in the foreseeable future.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, complications in the building industry, such as a lack of trained manpower and building resources, have obstructed construction activities. According to , the shortage of trades labor is not expected to get better any time soon and construction technologies have yet to evolve to make up the difference in cost or productivity. Additionally,  states that new building could ease off further as construction projects are delayed as they are on the housing front because of a shortage of building materials. Furthermore,  mentions that building in towns and cities was hampered by the fact that the construction industry was working more or less at capacity, by a shortage of skilled workers and of materials, along with the emergence of protests here and there. Lastly,  states that rising labor shortages are exacerbating the challenges and that construction cost increases continued into the second quarter of 2022 amid inflationary pressures throughout the economy.\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

Despite their relatively modest sizes, all the Supernovas have above-average levels of economic diversity and white-collar employment, which explain their strong investor appeal and should help them sus- tain high growth in the years ahead.

Real estate markets are ever dynamic and metropolitan econo- mies even more so. The relative rankings of the markets tracked in Emerging Trends changed meaningfully this year as eco- nomic conditions in the United States appear to be heading for a slide. Nonetheless, many Magnet markets remain among the most favored, even if some of them have slipped a bit this year. At the same time, real estate professionals appear more willing to consider some markets that had been less in favor in recent years. The perpetual search for new opportunities ensures con- stant flux in how markets are viewed over time. Grouping the Markets After comprehensively reorganizing how we group our 80 geo- graphic markets two years ago and a lighter refresh last year, we are continuing with the same groupings this year and turn our focus to how the various groups and some key markets have changed since our previous report. Additional demo- graphic and economic data and more detailed descriptions of these market groups are available online, as listed at the end of this chapter. Magnets Magnet markets are migration destinations for both people and companies, and most are growing more quickly than the U. S. average in terms of both population and jobs. These metro areas are also the preferred markets for investors and builders, with the highest average Overall Real Estate Prospects ratings of any group in the Emerging Trends survey by a wide margin. Collectively, these markets account for almost one-third of the population base in the Emerging Trends coverage universe, the second-largest group in Markets to Watch. Super Sun Belt. These markets are large and diverse but still affordable, forming powerhouse economies that attract a wide range of businesses. Despite their large population bases, most are among the fastest-growing markets in the United States. Moreover, their economic performance has been solid through thick and thin. Though every market lost jobs during the pan- demic recession, recovery has been much quicker and more complete in the Super Sun Belt markets. These metro areas collectively have the highest average rating of any subgroup, as it did last year. 18-Hour Cities.;\n***\n[Submission]: The 18-Hour Cities rate third highest among the 12 subgroups, with an average Gross Metropolitan Product (GMP) of $211.3 per capita and a share of 32.3% of all Emerging Trends markets .\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

In addition, we analyze how opportunistic and value-add managers will need to adopt their strategies now that interest rates are higher, and how their ability to generate out-size returns simply by adding leverage is gone. So, a number of important topics for us and investors to consider. We hope you find our answers insightful and useful in determining your strategy and thinking about some of the key questions in real estate as we move into the new year. Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy. Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs. We have already started to see cap rates and yields rise in many markets, with the most rapid adjustment taking place in the UK. However, we do not think that prices fully reflect higher interest rates yet. To assess when values might bottom out, we can look to past downturns and the listed market for guidance. In the Global Financial Crisis, for example, global capital values bottomed out in 4Q09, while GDP across global real estate markets troughed three quarters earlier, in 1Q09, as did global listed real estate prices1. Market downturns usually present opportunities, and one we expect for investors in 2023 is a correction in pricing as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. Although we do not expect large amounts of distress in the market, we do expect some, already apparent in parts of the UK market. This should allow investors access to assets at attractive pricing. The early 1990s downturn was longer, with US capital values continuing to decline into 1995. We expect modest declines in GDP in the first half of 2023 before growth resumes.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!15: 5 Spiking rates drive rapid tightening of financial conditions Cost of capital rising sharply in most geographies Nominal corporate bond yields 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 7 0 n a J 8 0 n a J 9 0 n a J 0 1 n a J 1 1 n a J 2 1 n a J 3 1 n a J 4 1 n a J 5 1 n a J 6 1 n a J 7 1 n a J 8 1 n a J 9 1 n a J 0 2 n a J 1 2 n a J 2 2 n a J US C. Europe Singapore Japan United Kingdom Australia Canada Source: Bloomberg. As of November 30, 2022. LOOKING AHEAD  The relentless math of higher interest rates will continue to weigh heavily on real estate values, at least until interest rates stabilize as inflation begins to subside. The bid- ask spread for private real estate should eventually close and transactions will resume in earnest at a rebased level.  In the meantime, investment styles that are less sensitive to volatility in values should be contemplated, such as floating-rate lending with a comfortable cushion from lower loan-to-value ratios. Debt investment can be attractive at times of uncertainty, as investors tilt toward contractually certain income and away from an uncertain upside. Portfolio aggregation strategies with smaller asset sizes that lend themselves to averaging-in with diversified timing of entry points represent another way to cope with volatile and uncertain values.  The inputs to the math are not changing to the same degree in every part of the world. Wherever rate spikes are less intense, or the prospects for rental growth are clearest, transaction activity and prices have been less impacted.  In addition to debt costs, investors should also consider the trajectory of cash flows, which depend on economic fundamentals and real estate occupier market conditions. The differential prospects for real estate cash flows are the subject of the next section.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!7:  Declines in consumer confidence over the last year have been even sharper. All of these positive and negative factors together paint a kind of a Rorschach test, where observers can draw their own conclusions as to the strength of the economy. The End of the Beginning But there is one issue on which our interviewees agree: The exis- tential risk for the real estate economy right now is that Fed action in response to persistent inflation will tip us into a recession, says a senior partner with a leading advisory firm. But can the Federal Reserve Bank tame inflation without breaking the economy? Moderating inflation rates this summer led many to believe that the worst was over and that the Fed could soon ease up its con- tractionary monetary policy. Indeed, the consensus of experts we interviewed this summer was that the Fed would cease tightening by the end of 2022 and start cutting rates again in mid-2023. That sentiment now appears optimistic. Inflation is going to be a little stickier than people think, said an investment banking executive we interviewed during the summer, whose views turned out to be more prescient. Sentiment started changing in late August when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell gave his annual speech to fellow central bankers affirming the Fed view that infla- tion is not nearly under control, jolting markets. Any remaining doubt about that was quashed by the official Fed commentary accompanying their September rate announcement projecting that rates would keep rising through 2023. As Winston Churchill famously cautioned after the British army won a critical WWII battle, the victory marked not the end, not even the beginning of the end, but, possibly, the end of the beginning. 4 Higher for Longer With interest rates headed higher for longer, the risk of a deeper, full-fledged recession is rising, according to a grow- ing consensus of economists. In an August 2022 survey by the National Association of Business Economics, only a quarter of economists were even somewhat confident that the Fed could bring down inflation to its target range without causing a recession. Worrying signs out of Europe in early autumn and expectations of soaring heating bills this coming winter add to the gloomy global economic outlook.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!16:  G LO BA L 2 The path of fundamentals will ultimately help determine where values settle Early in 2022, we framed the impact of rising inflation and interest rates on values as a race between debt costs and net operating income growth, as we anticipated that higher inflation would translate into higher rents in some sectors. Currently, it seems that debt costs are mostly winning the race. Ultimately, however, valuations are the result of the interaction between higher debt costs and the path of real estate fundamentals, the prospects for which vary widely across sectors and geographies. Tracing back real estate cash flows to their drivers is to follow a chain of causation back to basic variables like population, GDP, industrial production, consumer spending and employment. All of these interact with real estate factors, such as the balance of property supply and occupier demand, to influence property cash flows. Secular megatrends and structural features like legal and contractual constraints also matter. Going into 2023, there is increased uncertainty in many of these variables, especially the economic ones, given the pace of economic expansion is expected to be weaker or negative. This will have a cooling impact on property NOI growth, but nuances remain given that the transmission of macroeconomic conditions to real estate is a winding path. Starting with the underlying economic fundamentals, we are seeing a great deal of variation globally. In addition to the dimensions of depth and duration, a key uncertainty surrounding the coming downturn is how widespread it will be. Europe faces especially severe challenges stemming from an energy price shock, with ripple effects of unknown global scope. The dominant driver of inflation in the US, Canada and Singapore is that their economies are robust and operating close to full capacity. Demand- led inflation is relatively benign compared to inflation from a supply shock, but the central banks in these countries must still raise interest rates, either to manage their domestic economic situations or because their monetary policies are linked to the US Federal Reserve . Rising interest rates create clear risks to economic growth, with housing markets already being impacted by higher mortgage rates. Europes employment picture is also solid, but in addition to home-grown inflation, it is coping with a severe, energy-driven supply shock caused by the Russia-Ukraine war.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, as soon as inflation begins to decrease, the increase in interest rates will cease to impact real estate values.\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

The denominator effect can be magnified because CRE values in a portfolio are generally appraisal-based, which tend to be backward-looking. However, the impact on CRE portfolios may not be severe this time. Many institutional investors have been under-allocated in CRE, so they will not need to rebalance by selling real estate assets. Furthermore, a rising share of CRE investors is not gov- erned by fixed asset allocations, including public REITs, private investment firms, and high-net-worth individuals, and especially nontraded REITs, which have grown to be among the leading investors in CRE, with an asset value of almost $300 billion in 2021. In sum, capital availability should decline in the near term, though the denominator effect may not force sales as much as in typical downturns. Uncertainty Hesitancy Perhaps the biggest headwind to getting deals done now is uncertainty over where prices will settle. Reflecting the views of many experts we interviewed, one senior investment banker says, Transactions are being done at cap rates that are anywhere from 25 to 75 basis points wider than they werebut there is not any conviction that these are the right levels. That translates into a 5 to 15 percent drop in values so far, with more to come. But there are too few assets trading now to know for sure. Buyers are concerned about overpaying. Says one banker: Now is not the time to be a heromeaning, its not the time to go out and be aggressive on buying something. Its not the time to be aggressive on borrowing. On the other hand, sellers dont want to sell their assets short and then see them retraded at higher prices once the markets improve and few suffer from the financial distress that forces them to. It all translates into fewer deals. One senior adviser to institutional investors said, Its pen- cils down in investment committee. We cant get an acquisition or disposition approved in investment committee at this time. The fundamental issue for many investors is how long the Fed will keep raising rates.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!13: 0 G LO BA L A S I A PAC I F I C E U R O P E N O R T H A M E R I CA G LO BA L - 1 The math of spiking interest rates is driving a repricing of real estate In a completely efficient market, real estate pricing should be closely linked to that of the other asset classes that make up the broader investable universe. Investors should receive similar ex ante returns for similar risks, or else any free lunches will be arbitraged away. In practice, private market real estate pricing tends to be impacted by broader capital market shifts mainly when there are changes in the cost of real estate debt, since the marginal buyer of income-producing real estate is most often a leveraged buyer. When debt costs rise, the market thins before price pressures are reflected in transactions. This tends to create a time lag between higher interest rates and declines in private equity real estate pricing. In most markets globally, we are now feeling the impact of more expensive real estate debt, which in many cases is no longer accretive to returns at current private market valuations. The math of debt costs and going-in yields is relentless. When the yield starting point is especially low in absolute terms, modest increases in debt costs and yields as measured in basis points mathematically translate into big percentage changes in capital values. As such, evidence of the most significant repricing to date has been concentrated in the lowest- yielding sectors, where transactions have held up most. This has surprised some observers since these low-yielding property types are mostly the winning sectors of recent years and they continue to possess attractive growth profiles. That some of the largest recent value declines may be occurring in the most sought- after property types, such as logistics and residential, might come as a shock after years of banner outperformance, especially during the pandemic. Even so, these property types remain the strongest performers over longer trailing periods and values have also fallen in the less favored sectors, although such adjustments are masked by lower price transparency in these property types. This repricing has been labeled mechanical by some because it is a function of exogenous debt assumptions increasing in investors spreadsheets.;\n\nreal_estate_index:outlook-real-estatet-market-germany-dec-2022.pdf-!12:  In principle, many investment managers and other capital collection agencies still have plenty of money to invest, and capital sources such as insurance companies and pension institutions are continuously receiving more money to invest. However, the trend in recent years of more and more of this money flowing into the real estate markets may have been broken with the turnaround in interest rates. The artificially low interest rates have made the money and bond market unattractive for many years. In addition, central banks have squeezed private investors out of the market with their securities purchase programmes and forced them to invest their money elsewhere, including in real estate. If this period now comes to an end, it could result in a countervailing reallocation process. In combination with monetary tightening, there would then be less money available for real estate investments than before until the long-term growth trend gains the upper hand again. From a German perspective, there is another question: how safe is Germany still perceived as an investment haven? For the moment, we believe we can observe that overseas investors at least have become more cautious. The economic weakness plays a role here, as does the war in Ukraine. On the other hand, the euro has depreciated and the interest rate differential of the euro area against most other currencies has increased significantly. Both make the euro area and thus also Germany more attractive for investors from non-euro countries.

Sales volumes jumped to over $800 billion in 2021, according to MSCI Real Assetsalmost double the depressed total in the first pandemic year of 2020 and nearly one-third more than the prior $600 billion record reached in 2019. The surge continued into 2022, with sales volumes in the first half of the year up 38 percent over the same period last year, as even the sharp rise in interest rates did little to dampen transaction volumes. But these recent volumes do not tell the whole storyand the story they do tell may be misleading as to where property markets seem to be heading. Discussions with numerous participants from all corners of the industry confirm that many investors have moved to the sidelinesor to other types of assets like equities and bonds. Indeed, the recent surge may well reflect a last gasp to get deals done before the expected increase in interest rates. Fewer Investors Fewer investors and lenders will be providing capital for assets, according to this years Emerging Trends survey: expectations of availability declined for every one of the 13 equity and debt capital sources. Over the past decade, CRE markets benefited from a substantial capital inflow as alternative investment classes have gained wider acceptance and real estate offered compel- ling risk-adjusted returns. Now, some of those inflows look to reverse. Investor interest is still healthy, but not what it was. Instead of seven or 10 competing offers for sale, theres now two or three, which I think thats normal, says the head of an investment firm. Thats normalizing, too. Several forces look to restrict investor demand, starting with the lower expected returns discussed in our Normalizing trend. Rising interest rates are making acquisition and construc- tion debt more expensive, just when operating incomes seem destined to slide as the economy weakens in the forecasted downturn. Indeed, the prospect of lower income and higher costs is breaking deals, as buyers either seek price breaks or pull out altogether.;\n***\n[Submission]: No, it is not reasonable to expect the denominator effect to compel all institutional investors to offload their real estate holdings. According to , many institutional investors have been under-allocated in CRE, so they will not need to rebalance by selling real estate assets. Furthermore, a rising share of CRE investors is not governed by fixed asset allocations, including public REITs, private investment firms, and high-net-worth individuals, and especially nontraded REITs, which have grown to be among the leading investors in CRE, with an asset value of almost $300 billion in 2021. In sum, capital availability should decline in the near term, though the denominator effect may not force sales as much as in typical downturns.\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

Similarly, workers with the ability to work entirely remotely may choose to stay in a destination for an extended period and work from there. This may end up helping to offset any poten- tially permanent fallout from traditional business travel demand. Recovery in Top 25 Markets Hotels in highly dense urban markets experienced the greatest decline and slowest initial rebound during the downturn. The initial uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, and the govern- ments response, resulted in a dramatic shift in demand away from urban cores and toward drive-to leisure markets and resort destinations, which, as a result, rebounded the most quickly. With pandemic-related regulations and restrictions largely being phased out, urban markets are getting closer to fully reopened and experiencing recent surges in lodging demand, giving pric- ing power to the operators. So far, the resurgence in demand in these markets is attributed, in descending order, to leisure, group, and business travel. Inbound international travel has contributed to the recovery in several of the top 25 markets and is expected to play an even larger part in the recovery through the remainder of 2022 and into 2023. The U. S. Travel Association predicts that international arrivals will total 47.9 million by the end of 2022 and 65 million by the end of 2023, representing 60 and 82 percent of 2019 inbound international traffic levels, respectively. The increase in international arrivals in 2022 represents a 117 percent increase over 2021. Inbound international travel restrictions were lifted in early sum- mer 2022, but the resultant positive impact on inbound travel is not expected to really emerge until at least the fourth quarter of 2022.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Deloitte 2023 Commercial Real Estate Outlook.pdf-!11:  JLL forecasts that tourism should return to those levels by 2023 to 2024, offering some relief to dips in sales and demand resulting from the pandemic.33 Retailer spending on artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to grow by as much as US$20 billion by 2026, and more retailers will likely use first-party transaction data to support sales momentum and customer experience.34 Retailers in AP that have incorporated AI are seeing an up to 19 improvement in customer engagement.35 A South Korean convenience operator has added digital imaging and cloud point of sale (POS) software into their first fully automated smart stores.36 Hotel HOW DID WE GET HERE? The global lodging sector proved resilient in 2021 and so far through 2022. Increasing access to vaccinations, government stimulus money, and general lockdown fatigue are generally credited with boosting leisure travel in the second half of the year. Global occupancy levels exceeded prepandemic levels in April and May of 2022. In late July, hotel occupancy in the United States topped 72, up 1 from last year, but still off 7 percentage points from 2019. Average daily room rates have paced to the third highest level on record to US$157. Outside of the United States, occupancies were 68, still down from a comparable week in 2019 of around 75. However, the daily average rate for room bookings is up 17 from 2019 to US$144.37 However, regional recoveries have varied. In general, areas dependent on leisure travel, such as Miami and the Maldives, have recovered more quickly than those reliant on business travel.38 Although, as of June, many people became more comfortable traveling54 of Deloittes consumer tracker survey respondents feel safe flying and 66 of respondents feel safe staying in a hotel, both record highs since data tracking began in April 2020. Near-term business travel expectations also increased with 64 of consumer survey respondents indicating they are likely to travel for business within the next 3 months, the highest points since coverage began.39 WHATS NEXT? Consumer spending is expected to shift from goods to services, which would benefit this sector.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!115:  While summer vacationing was a driver of strong hotel performance domestically for the second summer in a row, the return of inbound international travel will be a key driver in pro- pelling the lodging sectors recovery through the fall months, the holiday season, and into 2023 for top gateway cities. After recovery in smaller markets outpaced the top 25 markets in 2020 and 2021, the acceleration in performance has shifted back to the top 25. Performance in the top 25 markets is trend- ing upward, although recovery is uneven across these markets. According to CoStar, New York, Boston, and Los Angeles have experienced the most robust year-over-year recovery so far in 2022, while markets such as San Francisco substantially lag pre-pandemic performance levels. New York has benefited from increased demand in all areas, particularly the early stages of international and business travel in the first half of 2022, followed by international and domestic leisure over the summer months. Improvement in Los Angeles was propelled by a higher concentration of luxury rooms, which were able to maintain, or even exceed, pre-pandemic rates with less price-sensitive guests. Bostons demand resurgence took off in the second quarter of 2022, primarily driven by increased levels of leisure and group travel. CoStar reports that Bostons market RevPAR through the first half of 2022 reached 88 per- cent of 2019 levels. San Franciscos struggles have been primarily tied to slower recovery in international traffic and recent changes in the tech workforce, the citys primary industry. Prior to the pandemic, travelers from China made up the majority of San Franciscos international visitations. With nonessential overseas travel still banned in China as of the late September 2022 publication of this report, it is uncertain when San Francisco will experience the same benefits from inbound international traffic as other markets. The outlook for business traffic in San Francisco also is unclear, as the tech workforce has largely shifted to hybrid and remote working models.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!40: 6 Asia-Pacific travel and tourism highly dependent on Chinese visitors Projected availability by industrial market and submarket International visitor arrival and the proportion of international visitors from China Greater Seoul Greater Beijing Greater Bay Area Greater Shanghai Greater Tokyo A S I A PAC I F I C 180 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 k c o t s l l a t o t f o a s a y p p u s d e t c e o r P j 63 56 49 42 35 28 21 14 7 0 e t a R y c n a c a V t s e t a L l u o e S r e t a e r G l a r t n e C l u o e S t s e W u o e S l g n i j i e B r e t a e r G g n i j i e B g n a f g n a L n e h z n e h S n a h s o F a e r A y a B r e t a e r G i a h g n a h S r e t a e r G i a h g n a h S u h s g n a h C o y k o T r e t a e r G a w a g a n a K d n a n l I 6 1 e t u o R o D - u k o h o T Projected supply as a percentage of total stock (LHS) Projected supply as a percentage of total stock (2024) (LHS) Latest vacancy Rate (RHS) Note: The latest vacancy rates and the total stock numbers used for the availability calculation are as of July 2022 for Japan markets and as of Q3 2022 for other markets except Foshan.

Technology, which has expanded every year as proptech applications have revolutionized the management and valuation tools used by practitioners. Prospective: In the year 2025 The lessons of the early 1990s are clear: real estate down-cycles do not last forever. Reflecting on the frightening memories of plummeting values, empty buildings, bankruptcies and the Resolution Trust Corporation , suggests that the current round of credit tightening is likely to pale in comparison. The 2023 edition of LaSalles ISA Outlook anticipates the impacts of the rising cost of credit, a stall in economic growth and a pause in the multi-decade pattern of real estate appreciation. However, it does not extrapolate these trends far into the future. The human tendency to latch onto a few pieces of information and to expect that a narrow set of recent facts will shape future events is known as anchoring bias. When investing in a long-duration asset class like real estate, a longer-term, holistic view is more valuable. In 2014, the apocalyptic visions of German film director, Fritz Langs 1927 masterpiece Metropolis were put alongside the 1960s rock song 2525. The irony of bringing together dark images from one era, while listening to music from another, through the technology of a more recent YouTube artist is symbolic of how imperfectly clever we are at predicting the future. The eerily weird Lang-2525 juxtaposition implicitly illustrates how resilient humanity can be, even while contemplating what seem like existential threats such as fascism, industrialization and robots in the 1920s, nuclear holocausts in the 1960s. Financial panics in the 1990s and again in 2008-2010 and climate change and geopolitical conflict in the 2020s. Josef Schumpeter is most well-remembered for popularizing the term creative destruction. He is less remembered for his work on democratic theory.

Nonetheless, the glow for this category has faded somewhat as their unfettered growth has invited some big-city problems like congestion and rising living costs. Last years shooting star, Boise, fell sharply after two years in the top 20. Raleigh has continued its modest decline, from the top-rated market in 2021 to number six in the 2023 survey. But more broadly, the Supernovas appear to be suffering some growing pains, as discussed elsewhere in this report. Housing construction is not keeping pace with household growth, strain- ing housing affordability, which has been one of the chief attractions. The Establishment The Establishment markets have long been the nations eco- nomic engines. The 20 markets in this category produce almost 43 percent of the GMP in the 80 Emerging Trends markets while accounting for only 34 percent of its population base. This pri- marily reflects the outsized contributions of the nations gateway markets, which we refer to as the Knowledge and Innovation Centers. Though growing more slowly than the Magnet markets, the Establishment markets still offer tremendous opportunities. This groups average rating is second among our four major group- ings. However, the appeal of these markets to investors and developers has waned in recent years as growth has slowed across many of these markets while challenges have increased. Multitalented Producers. Though all the Establishment markets are large and economically varied, some are more diverse than others, specifically the multitalented metro areas of Chicago, Los Angeles, San Jose, and Seattle. Workers here tend to be productive, with per capita GMP ranking the second highest of any of the subgroups. Though their elevated cost of doing business and getting deals done limits their appeal for some real estate professionals, the Multitalented Producers Exhibit 3-8 U.

Many of the changes were relatively minor, and nine of the 10 highest-rated markets last year repeated this year . But there were some material changes over the year as about a quarter of markets moved up or down in rankings by at least 10 places. And consistent with our normal- izing trend, many of the markets near the top of the standings last year have fallen this year, while many previously lower- rate markets have risen: More than half (11) of the 20-highest rated markets in last years survey fell in the rankings this year, although almost all by less than 10 places. Meanwhile, some of the markets that were found lower in the rankings in prior years are now finding more support. Thirteen of the 20-lowest rated markets in last years survey rose in the rankings this year. Some Like It Hot Despite the modest drop in the Supernova ratings this year, Emerging Trends survey respondents still see the best prospects in Sun Belt metropolitan areas, which have been growing over time. The number of Sun Belt markets among the top 20 markets for overall prospects has increased from 10 in 2011 to 14 in each of the past two years. At the same time, the number of markets in cold-weather climates in the Northeast and Midwest has declined from five to just two . These climate preferences are even stronger at the top and bot- tom of the rankings.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!132:  Only Boston remains among the 20 top-rated markets.

This group includes the markets sur- rounding high-cost CBDs in Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, San Francisco, and Washington, D. C. Though most are subur- ban in character, some are more urban. Moreover, several are or contain metropolitan statistical areas in their own right. Many of these markets benefited from the out-migration from their neighboring CBDs during the pandemic, and their prospects have improved somewhat in the eyes of survey respondents.

The relative rankings of the markets tracked in Emerging Trends changed meaningfully this year as eco- nomic conditions in the United States appear to be heading for a slide. Nonetheless, many Magnet markets remain among the most favored, even if some of them have slipped a bit this year. At the same time, real estate professionals appear more willing to consider some markets that had been less in favor in recent years. The perpetual search for new opportunities ensures con- stant flux in how markets are viewed over time. Grouping the Markets After comprehensively reorganizing how we group our 80 geo- graphic markets two years ago and a lighter refresh last year, we are continuing with the same groupings this year and turn our focus to how the various groups and some key markets have changed since our previous report. Additional demo- graphic and economic data and more detailed descriptions of these market groups are available online, as listed at the end of this chapter. Magnets Magnet markets are migration destinations for both people and companies, and most are growing more quickly than the U. S. average in terms of both population and jobs. These metro areas are also the preferred markets for investors and builders, with the highest average Overall Real Estate Prospects ratings of any group in the Emerging Trends survey by a wide margin. Collectively, these markets account for almost one-third of the population base in the Emerging Trends coverage universe, the second-largest group in Markets to Watch. Super Sun Belt. These markets are large and diverse but still affordable, forming powerhouse economies that attract a wide range of businesses. Despite their large population bases, most are among the fastest-growing markets in the United States. Moreover, their economic performance has been solid through thick and thin. Though every market lost jobs during the pan- demic recession, recovery has been much quicker and more complete in the Super Sun Belt markets.

And the homes that do get built are expensive, particularly since the pandemic. Construction costs shot up due to supply chain disruptions and are still worrisome. As one housing industry adviser notes, Theres a stress index about global supply chains, and those stress indices are all indicating that theyre moderating, but theyre still at very high levels. Finally, high permitting fees and utility charges and large minimum lot sizes push developers to build more expensive homes. Renters Priced Out of the Homebuying Market With a growing share of households priced out of the for-sale market, demand for rental units is far outstripping new supply. Though population growth slowed sharply during the pandemic, demand is also rising from the many young adults eager to start their own households after moving back in with their parents during COVID. Further boosting demand is the increasing number of younger adults choosing to live alone, according The multifamily sector has responded with an unprecedented increase in new supply. Weve built more multifamily housing units over the last 10 years than we had in any other time since 1980, notes an adviser to institutional investors. But it is still far less than needed. Vacancies have fallen to their lowest levels ever while rents are rising faster than evereven faster than home prices. And though not a formal part of the affordability calculations, other housing-related costs like utilities and main- tenance are also rising faster than incomes, further constraining the ability of households to afford basic shelter. Moving to More Affordable Recent slowdowns in rent growth and home price appreciation, noted in our Normalizing trend, have done little to increase affordability. So how to address this?

Too Much for Too Many  Housing affordability has fallen to its lowest level in over 30 years. Prices and rents have soared relative to incomes. Spiraling mortgage rates have pushed the homeownership bar further out of reach for a growing share of households.  The chronic undersupply of housing is the result of govern- ment policies that limit new supply or increase construction costs and is exacerbated by a labor shortage, as well as NIMBYism.  Simply constructing more housing may be the most obvious and effective solution, but is far from easy to achieve. Housing is too expensive. It has been that way for too longfor too many people neither for-sale nor rental housing is afford- ablebut prices and rents have soared even further out of reach over the course of the past year. And even if we experi- ence an economic downturn, as many economists expect, it is not projected to provide significant relief. It starts with record home prices. The U. S. median existing- home price jumped by over 18 percent in 2021 alonethe largest increase on record going back to the early 1950s and then tacked on a further 15 percent through mid-2022. Combined with rapidly rising mortgage rates, housing afford- ability has fallen to its lowest level in over 30 years relative to incomes, according to the National Association of Realtors.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!84:  46 65 G Exhibit 2-9 Reasons Renters Continue to Rent, Based on Rental Households That Believe Homeownership Is Important Exhibit 2-10 Footprint Allocated to the Homes Outdoor Space, 2021 versus 2020 58 47 67 35 Need to save for downpayment Life circumstances Cannot afford mortgage payments 37 34 Lack of supply 28 11 Require the exibility to move if desiredneeded Cannot take on the maintenance responsibilities 19 16 Would rather spend money on other things 13 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Source: New Home Trends Institute by John Burns Real Estate Consulting LLC.

New residents want to be con- nectedespecially via the outdoorswith their neighbors and amenity programming. Lifestyle directors can make an outsized impact in new communities. Her focus for new communities is to make outdoor spaces livable all year long, with heating and cooling elements to make residents comfortable. Historically, affordability has played a key role in housing pur- chase decisions, and the rise in home prices along with higher mortgage rates has brought affordability to the forefront. Over 67 percent of households who rent cite the lack of a down payment as the biggest hurdle to homeownership. Builders have always struggled to provide affordable housing, but the rise in the cost of materials over the past two years has impeded any progress. However, some builders are starting to report lower costs especially laboras the market cools. The key to improving affordability, according to the CEO of a national firm specializing in residential architecture, is lowering 7 7 0 Much more footprint Slightly more footprint Same footprint Slightly less footprint Much less footprint Source: 2022 Annual Survey of Architecture.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!177: 4 percent in 20202021 from 0.5 percent in 20012002.

Even if affordability eventually improves with falling housing prices, the reality is that the key issue underpinning the crisis is insufficient sup- ply to meet high demand for all types of homes. Demand will continue to rise, especially as the Canadian government com- mits to higher immigration targets in the coming years and the country welcomes large numbers of temporary residents, like international students, who also need places to live. This means that even as homebuilding activity has been rising, tight market conditions have put pressures on affordability that are unlikely to ease significantly. As we noted, some interviewees are looking at pausing housing developmentsoften condo projectsas they deal with cost and financing challenges as well as soften- ing demand due to rising interest rates.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, the affordability of housing has dropped in recent years, affecting both young and mid-career households.

The hottest metro areas may soon face declining demandand potentially an exodus due to unbearable weather, even as households continue to migrate from colder climates to warmer metro areas overall. Large swathes of Texas and the U. S. Southwest have endured 100-degree highs almost every day this summer, with nighttime temperatures frequently not dipping below 80 degrees. And its not confined to just the Southwest. Heat domes have settled over the Pacific Northwest during the past two summers, bring- ing heatwaves unprecedented in their length and intensity. The built environment intensifies climate change as buildings and roads absorb and retain heat. This heat island effect raises not only daytime peaks but especially nighttime tempera- tures, which can be hazardous to humans if they cannot cool down at night. Sun Belt cities like Phoenix and Dallas are work- ing with CRE owners to reduce heat islands by expanding the tree canopy, adding reflective coatings or vegetation to roofs, and using cool pavements to reduce the heat absorption of asphalt streets and concrete sidewalks. These approaches are important and necessary but may ultimately prove inadequate to the challenge if climate change keeps ratcheting up tempera- tures as expected. Beyond the discomfort and health risks of living in ever-hotter climates, energy costs rise with temperatures, as do the risks of power outages as more strain is placed on power grids. A less obvious cost: higher temperatures and ultraviolet exposure can increase building maintenance costs. Extreme weather worsened by climate change is even exacerbating inflation as 24 Exhibit 1-16 Percentage of U. S.

More disturbing is the increase in severe summer storms, excluding climate events like drought, flooding, and wildfires. The number of billion-dollar severe storms has jumped from less than one per year in the 1980s to 12 in this decadea 15-fold increase in less than 40 years and trending further upward. Just in the recent summer of 2022, we experienced five once-in- a-1,000-year storms in Dallas, Death Valley, central and southern Illinois, Kentucky, and St. Louis, which recorded the most intense rainfall in the citys history. These storms demonstrate that build- ings and infrastructure are poorly equipped to withstand the changing climatemuch less what might be coming. There is still a political divide in the country about what is to blame for climate change, and what, if anything, to do about it. But there is now growing agreement about its prevalence. Fully two-thirds of Americans surveyed by the Pew Research Center in 2021 believe that extreme weather events across the United States occur more often than in the past. Close to half say that it is hitting close to home as their community has recently experienced severe weather like floods and intense storms or long periods of unusually hot weather . Last year in these pages, we highlighted the role of commercial real estate in acceleratingor potentially mitigatingclimate change, in a trend we called Climate Risks Are on Us. Despite recent calls by some CRE leaders that we should deemphasize ESG issues now as we grapple with growing economic threats, many in our industry are continuing to answer societys call to do even more to reduce our carbon footprint. But with climate risks climbing still further, this year we highlight climates impact on us as owners, managers, and users of real propertyand how our industry can proactively address the impacts of climate change on our assets.

Depending on the jurisdiction, the focus varies from the narrower goal of hardening against physical risk, to full decarbonization. European countries are moving at different speeds, but all in the same direction. Policies in US states are diverging based on political dynamics. In Asia Pacific, the trend is mixed. Despite this variation, the events of 2022 have dramatically reinforced the need for action on climate change, both at the macro level of governments and industry and at the micro level of property-specific resilience and futureproofing. Investors should continue to plan and take action to adapt portfolios to evolving climate-related risks. Weather over the past year has almost certainly caused the pile of catastrophic insurance losses to keep mounting . Hurricane Ian was the fifth-strongest hurricane to make landfall in the United States and may prove to be the costliest in history. Severe damage, including complete destruction, has occurred to real estate in the storms path. Even properties that were relatively undisturbed were left cut off from road access, power, internet, water and even mobile service due to damaged infrastructure. A forceful hurricane season in 2022 was preceded by a sweltering summer in the Northern Hemisphere. Europe and China recorded their hottest-ever summers since recordkeeping began in 1880, according to NOAAs National Centers for Environmental Information. Meanwhile, Japan and the US recorded their second- and third-hottest summers, respectively. Knock-on economic effects included the pausing of railway service in Britain and the disruption of goods traffic on rivers in Europe and China due to low water levels.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!32:  LOOKING AHEAD  The European energy crisis shows how quickly energy efficiency can move from being nice to have to an economic imperative. The rest of the world is not in the same situation as Europe, but its experience shows that conditions can change quickly and it is better to prepare for the future than to be simply reactive.  Physical climate risk must be managed at two levels: at the portfolio level, through assessment of exposure concentrations and consideration of how climate risk informs overall portfolio construction strategies. And at the property level, through evaluating both existing and potential new hardening strategies to be more resilient against particular hazards.  Incremental investments in hardening against physical climate change, increasing energy efficiency and installing on-site renewables may, in certain situations and especially for existing portfolio assets in Europe, offer one of the most attractive risk-adjusted returns on capital available today.  The transition to a decarbonized world also brings nonphysical transition risks that tend to be specific to local markets. These include changes in insurance availability and costs, regulations, taxes, incentives, and changes in tenant and capital market demand.  For a deeper dive on the energy transition and how it relates to real estate strategies, have a look at LaSalles November 2022 report Decarbonization and the Evolution to Net Zero Carbon Real estate.

In Japan, yield curve control comes at the cost of a weak yen. If the Bank of Japan (BoJ) remains committed to keeping interest rates near zero, currency intervention, such as yen-buying to prevent further depreciation, could be on the table again. However, currency intervention has rarely been successful absent the cooperation from other central banks. Any changes to the yield control approach are likely to come after BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kurodas term concludes in April 2023. Nonetheless, most of the challenges Japan is facing are externally driven, while domestic-driven fundamentals remain relatively healthy. Australia, South Korea and Singapore are the most directly impacted by rising interest rates in the West. The outlook of these economies is likely to follow AP.1 Diverging monetary policies in Asia Pacific the trends in the West, albeit to varying degrees. The Monetary Authority of Singapore manages monetary policies through the foreign exchange markets, given that for a small and open economy, the exchange rate has a much stronger influence on inflation than the interest rate. That said, the magnitude of interest rate hikes in Singapore has been less than that of the US. Additionally, an increasing number of firms are pivoting to Singapore for their regional headquarters due to its geopolitical stability. All of these are adding to the relative strength of Singapores economy. The weakness of Asia Pacific currencies is mostly a story of US dollar strength. Nevertheless, uncertainties over the macro outlook and the dispersion among regional economies could lead to the continuing divergence of real estate market performance in the next 12-24 months.

Australia is cementing its status as a safe haven in the region. Singapores relative attractiveness to Hong Kong is expec- ted to increase. Higher interest rates are less of a concern in Japan where the spread between the risk-free rate and real estate yields remains stable. A zero-Covid-19 policy, a troubled property sector and geopolitical tensions have led to a risk premium for China. Asia Pacific Macro-economic trends The Asia-Pacific region is expected to grow faster during 2023- 2025 compared with the U. S. or EU with a lower risk of recession. Within the region, and for the first time in decades, it is expected that Australia and Singapore will record higher quarterly GDP growth figures in Q3 and Q4 2022 than China. During the outlook period, China is expected to recover and follow its growth path but at a slower pace .

The willingness and ability to invest large amounts of money in maintaining health is therefore correspondingly strong. An ever increasing number of people worldwide al- so have access to medical care. Life Sciences essentially consist of a combination of various scientific disciplines such as biology, chemistry, medicine and pharmaceuticals. In turn, the main activity of the biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and medical technology segments in focus he- re is research into living organisms. Life Sciences are associated with the develop- ment of economically successful products for human health rather than with funda- mental research. In Germany, biotechnology moved centre stage and gained additi- onal momentum with the approval of the first Covid vaccine. However, the path to producing a market-ready substance is long and fraught with obstacles. Only a fraction of the substances researched are actually successful. To achieve rapid progress, sufficiently large teams are needed. Growth in the number of jobs in Life Sciences is leading to correspondingly higher demand for properties and investment. According to estimates, more than 300,000 people in more than 2,000 companies are employed in the Life Sciences sector in Germany. Biotechnology is the smallest segment, while pharmaceuticals and medical technology employ signifi- cantly more people. The functions of the properties required range from pure offices via laboratories and pharmaceutical logistics to production plants. From our perspec- tive, this combination of office and laboratory  the lab office  is of particular interest to investors.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!8: 4 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021 2023e 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021 2023e LIFE SCIENCES: FOCUS ON HEALTH Research offices are a niche segment, but also a growth market Staying healthy as you age  who wouldnt want that? In simplified terms, this is the motivation driving the booming Life Sciences sector of the economy, which is resear- ching corresponding solutions. However, classic office premises are not appropriate for companies in this segment. Although office space is required for administrative and management functions, the main focus is on laboratory space used by the biolo- gists, chemists and medical staff who are carrying out the research. This combinati- on - the young lab offices segment - is of increasing interest to investors. What lies behind the lab office trend and what potential does it have? The Covid pandemic is a starting point for a review of this segment. It has not only shifted vaccine development into the public focus, but has also brought into the mainstream concepts such as vulnerable and pre-existing conditions to refer to people at risk of serious cases of Covid 19. Because people are living longer thanks to medical progress, these concepts apply to large sections of the population and not just to a small number of people. In 2021 in Germany more than one fifth of the po- pulation  around 18 million people  had reached the age of 65. However, increa- sed life expectancy has not so far been accompanied by improved fitness levels. In fact the opposite is true. A sedentary lifestyle, high-calorie food, ready meals contai- ning a lot of sugar, and the consumption of alcohol and tobacco have consequences, and considerably increase the risk of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, demen- tia, heart attacks, cancer and strokes. The growing number of older people suffering ill health is also a significant economic factor.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!16:  Despite the growth potential in this segment, the risk is therefore heigh- tened - particularly for properties outside the life science cluster - if there is a change of tenant or the tenant experiences difficulties. As the Covid pandemic has demonst- rated, even after the start-up phase and initial success there can certainly be set- backs here. In addition to BioNTech in Mainz, CureVac in Tbingen was also work- ing at full speed to develop a mRNA-based Covid 19 vaccine. However, BioNTech had the edge, which has benefited its shareholders and also in particular the city of Mainz. The Rhineland-Palatinate state capital generated billions in revenue from tra- de tax and is planning a biotechnology location with 5,000 jobs for which various lab office properties will be required.

The uneven impact of a return to physical offices in the living with COVID phase of the pandemic shows that investors should avoid projecting their own countrys view of a sector too far away from their home market. For example, office fundamentals remain relatively healthy in Asia and Continental Europe, while they are particularly weak in the US. G LO BA L 4 The balance of virtual and in-person interaction is close to a post-pandemic steady state Most parts of the world have reached the living with COVID phase of the pandemic. One sign of this is that the language around vaccinations has changed. No longer do we talk about being fully vaccinated or not, but about whether we are up-to-date on our seasonal boosters. Case counts continue to ebb and flow, but the incidence of serious health outcomes has fallen precipitously given widespread vaccine-based and natural immunity in most populations. As a result, COVID restrictions have been largely eliminated around the world. In the US and Europe, it is becoming rare to see anyone wearing a mask. Barriers to travel, such as quarantines, have been dropped even in places that once had strict constraints on entry, such as Hong Kong. The big exception to the removal of restrictions is mainland China, where periods of normalcy are interrupted by temporary lockdowns. But even in China, there are signs of change as public health policies continue to evolve. We follow a wide range of data sources to evaluate how close to pre-pandemic normalcy we are. These include Google mobility figures, office keycard entries, seated diners, airline enplanements and public transport ridership. These data indicate that despite a lack of restrictions, the degree of reversion to pre- pandemic norms is incomplete and uneven by activity and location. We divide our observations into work, play and live:  Work: Office attendance remains significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels in many geographies, especially the US, where weekly total keycard entries to office buildings are only 48 of pre-pandemic levels as of November 21, 2022.;\n***\n[Submission]: The difference between a virus and a bacteria is that viruses are much smaller than bacteria and can only reproduce inside the cells of other organisms, while bacteria are single-celled organisms that can reproduce on their own .\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

And one out of every four households spends 50 percent or more of their wages on housing. Those percentages reflect divides that deepen because not enough new apartment units are coming online. A present that is polarized grows more so over time. For market- rate property investors, developers, owners, and managers, what lies ahead is the brightest beacon of prosperity. But for those who live and reside below the cutline of wherewithal and social mobility, the future of apartment rentals holds more ques- tions than answers. With 1.3 million new U. S. households projected each year through 2035, apartment industry trade groupsthe National Multifamily Housing Council (NMHC) and the National Apartment Associationcalculate that the United States needs 4.3 million newly built apartments between now and then. That level of new development would work out to 331,000 new multifamily rental units annually. This would expand the exist- ing apartment rental stock in the United States by more than 20 percent in just over a decade. What makes this goal plausible are two strong tailwinds: household demographics and an unprecedented global embrace of apartment development by the investment community. Still, the throes of land use policy drag on development. But beyond local policy barriers, tugging housing to its future, are a trio of macro forcesworklife balance, an urgency to stall the climate effects of global warming, and an array of technolo- giesin business management, livability, and construction. Can this darling of real estate asset classes sustain its hold on global investment inflows, unleash constructions modern manu- facturing era, turn the tide on local political will, and win over the hearts, minds, and pocketbooks of consumer households to pull off such a feat? If you had to guess todaywith residential rental vacancies at historical lows of 6.2 percent and occupancy rates and median asking rents for vacant units at historical highsthe answer would be a cautious yes.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!67:  However, a gigantic hurdle stands in the way of telling fleet- ing trends apart from ones that will last: the pandemic and its aftermath.

The Pandemic: This Time Is Different With the pandemic and the cascade of economic and social policies it set off, five macro apartment industry tailwinds reached gale-force levels:  One, there was a preexisting multigenerational avalanche of both rent-by-choice and rent-by-necessity demand for multifamily rental units.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!69:  You cant build ground-up affordable because of the price of land, and the regulations that govern that, and everything the NIMBY activists rule . . it all puts a real damper on the industrys ability to produce. In mid-2022, yet another freshly drawn inflection pointcoin- ciding with the devastation wrought by the Russia-Ukraine war and an aggressive U. S. monetary and fiscal tightening effort to dial down inflationquickly spread the pain of a cost-of-living crisis across Americas households. In addition, it casts a new cloud of uncertainty over the near-term outlook for market-rate residential investment. The Push and Pull of Trends: Rentership Rising Broad-stroke household demographics point irrefutably to strong secular demand for multifamily rental apartment development. During the 2022-to-2035 stretch that lies ahead, 275 million adults the total of all the adult-aged generational cohortswill continue to make shelter decisions, especially as U. S. domes- tic migration and mobility continues at over 27 million movers each year. Financial factorsgiven that runaway costs and high mortgage interest rates will price more households out of homeownership as an optionwill determine many of their decisions, as has long been the case. What is different over the past several years has been growth in discretionary rental households, also known as rent-by-choice households. According to Harvards Joint Center for Housing Studies (JCHS), the number of renters making at least $75,000 jumped by 48 percent over the decade ending just before the pandemic, to 11.3 million. With this increase, the share of renter households in this income group rose from 20 percent to 26 percent.

And the homes that do get built are expensive, particularly since the pandemic. Construction costs shot up due to supply chain disruptions and are still worrisome. As one housing industry adviser notes, Theres a stress index about global supply chains, and those stress indices are all indicating that theyre moderating, but theyre still at very high levels. Finally, high permitting fees and utility charges and large minimum lot sizes push developers to build more expensive homes. Renters Priced Out of the Homebuying Market With a growing share of households priced out of the for-sale market, demand for rental units is far outstripping new supply. Though population growth slowed sharply during the pandemic, demand is also rising from the many young adults eager to start their own households after moving back in with their parents during COVID. Further boosting demand is the increasing number of younger adults choosing to live alone, according The multifamily sector has responded with an unprecedented increase in new supply. Weve built more multifamily housing units over the last 10 years than we had in any other time since 1980, notes an adviser to institutional investors. But it is still far less than needed. Vacancies have fallen to their lowest levels ever while rents are rising faster than evereven faster than home prices. And though not a formal part of the affordability calculations, other housing-related costs like utilities and main- tenance are also rising faster than incomes, further constraining the ability of households to afford basic shelter. Moving to More Affordable Recent slowdowns in rent growth and home price appreciation, noted in our Normalizing trend, have done little to increase affordability. So how to address this?

Page 4 of 8 The other would focus on fundamentals, and argue that even at a lower entry yield the potential for income growth over the investment period can mitigate some of the value depreciation from rising rates. We would side with the second argument. First, risk should define the yield. This means that assets with a higher risk profile will need to adjust to an even higher yield to maintain a risk premium over more core assets. And second, in a period of high inflation, the value of the income of an asset will erode unless it can generate rental growth. Higher yielding assets generally come from sectors with weak occupational demand, hence the risk of void periods and negative rental growth are much higher, particularly during a period of economic stress. Sectors including life sciences, student accommodation, cold storage logistics and self- storage where there are strong structural drivers to support rental growth, are expected to see the greatest value protection. This was welcome news for markets. While unlikely to change the JPY direction, we take comfort that both the government and the BoJ are on the same page. First, this helps to buy time until the US Fed softens its hawkish stance. Second, there is also a positive implication that the next BoJ governor due to be appointed in April 2023 will not deviate materially. To be clear, an exit from the ultra-loose policy is possible in the medium-term. However, it will most likely be done in a gradual manner. For 2023, at least, the current policy should stay and the chances are even higher now that the peak of global inflation and interest rates are drawing close. Will Japan remain an outlier market with low interest rates? With VC funding slowing, what is the outlook for life sciences real estate?

In Japan, yield curve control comes at the cost of a weak yen. If the Bank of Japan (BoJ) remains committed to keeping interest rates near zero, currency intervention, such as yen-buying to prevent further depreciation, could be on the table again. However, currency intervention has rarely been successful absent the cooperation from other central banks. Any changes to the yield control approach are likely to come after BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kurodas term concludes in April 2023. Nonetheless, most of the challenges Japan is facing are externally driven, while domestic-driven fundamentals remain relatively healthy. Australia, South Korea and Singapore are the most directly impacted by rising interest rates in the West. The outlook of these economies is likely to follow AP.1 Diverging monetary policies in Asia Pacific the trends in the West, albeit to varying degrees. The Monetary Authority of Singapore manages monetary policies through the foreign exchange markets, given that for a small and open economy, the exchange rate has a much stronger influence on inflation than the interest rate. That said, the magnitude of interest rate hikes in Singapore has been less than that of the US. Additionally, an increasing number of firms are pivoting to Singapore for their regional headquarters due to its geopolitical stability. All of these are adding to the relative strength of Singapores economy. The weakness of Asia Pacific currencies is mostly a story of US dollar strength. Nevertheless, uncertainties over the macro outlook and the dispersion among regional economies could lead to the continuing divergence of real estate market performance in the next 12-24 months.

Weakened currencies could help European exports, but most other economies are slowing too, so it is unlikely to be a salvation for European companies Although households and corporates have higher expectations of government support than at any other time in history, conditioned by experiences since the GFC and the pandemic, sovereign balance sheets are less able than ever to sustain such support. This situation will be even more pronounced in the UK, with its faster time frame for quantitative tightening (QT) allied to its recent chastening by bond markets. The ECB, even once it begins QT of the main balance sheet, will still maintain a spread-control tool allowing for selective purchases of peripheral government debt to set a channel around eurozone sovereign borrowing rates. The relatively limited capacity of European government coffers to support productivity- enhancing investment does, however, offer an opportunity for private sector investors. The removal of the interest rate distortions that were the objective of QE will allow capital allocators to better assess investment projects, hopefully allowing for growing the capital stock rather than inflating speculative asset bubbles. Although the return to more historically typical levels of interest rates will be jarring, the equilibrium state is potentially benign.

LOOKING AHEAD  The relentless math of higher interest rates will continue to weigh heavily on real estate values, at least until interest rates stabilize as inflation begins to subside. The bid- ask spread for private real estate should eventually close and transactions will resume in earnest at a rebased level.  In the meantime, investment styles that are less sensitive to volatility in values should be contemplated, such as floating-rate lending with a comfortable cushion from lower loan-to-value ratios. Debt investment can be attractive at times of uncertainty, as investors tilt toward contractually certain income and away from an uncertain upside. Portfolio aggregation strategies with smaller asset sizes that lend themselves to averaging-in with diversified timing of entry points represent another way to cope with volatile and uncertain values.  The inputs to the math are not changing to the same degree in every part of the world. Wherever rate spikes are less intense, or the prospects for rental growth are clearest, transaction activity and prices have been less impacted.  In addition to debt costs, investors should also consider the trajectory of cash flows, which depend on economic fundamentals and real estate occupier market conditions. The differential prospects for real estate cash flows are the subject of the next section.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, the Bank of Japan's commitment to keeping interest rates near zero can lead to a strong yen.

In addition, we analyze how opportunistic and value-add managers will need to adopt their strategies now that interest rates are higher, and how their ability to generate out-size returns simply by adding leverage is gone. So, a number of important topics for us and investors to consider. We hope you find our answers insightful and useful in determining your strategy and thinking about some of the key questions in real estate as we move into the new year. Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy. Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs. We have already started to see cap rates and yields rise in many markets, with the most rapid adjustment taking place in the UK. However, we do not think that prices fully reflect higher interest rates yet. To assess when values might bottom out, we can look to past downturns and the listed market for guidance. In the Global Financial Crisis, for example, global capital values bottomed out in 4Q09, while GDP across global real estate markets troughed three quarters earlier, in 1Q09, as did global listed real estate prices1. Market downturns usually present opportunities, and one we expect for investors in 2023 is a correction in pricing as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. Although we do not expect large amounts of distress in the market, we do expect some, already apparent in parts of the UK market. This should allow investors access to assets at attractive pricing. The early 1990s downturn was longer, with US capital values continuing to decline into 1995. We expect modest declines in GDP in the first half of 2023 before growth resumes.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!13:  More than half believe that capitalization rates are heading up next year and returns are coming down, primarily due to rising interest rates and cost of capital, which was the top economic concern voiced in our survey. After more than a decade of lower for longer, the Fed is finally normalizing interest rates closer to historical levels. Those rising interest rates are already driving up debt costs and thus the costs to acquire and develop property, reducing leveraged returns. At the same time, the federal government is done with providing stimulus, indirectly reducing tenant demand for space. Unlike in the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and during the pandemic, nobodys coming to the rescue, and now we got to take our medicine, and here it comes, says the head of research for an investment management firm. Thus, the government is turning off both the monetary and fiscal spigots that had been support- ing commercial real estate and the economy overall. The head of a development company summarized it like this: I feel like weve been on a little bit of a sugar high with this stimu- lus and cheap debt. Theres going to be a slowdown. Theres got to be this normalization. So, what does that mean? I think its going to be a little bouncy. Its going to be a little bit turbulent. But then we bottom out, and we start back into growth. 2.  Still, Weve Changed Some  The pandemic forced structural shifts in how and where we live, work, and recreate in ways that seem destinated to endure.  Online spending is receding from its pandemic peaks but is not likely to revert to pre-pandemic levels. Business travel is unlikely to recover to pre-COVID levels for at least several years, meaning business hotels, fine dining, and conference facilities will continue to face challenges.  The greatest changes may be in how and where we work. The impact on office use and leasing is still evolving, and a significant share of the existing stock may need to be reposi- tioned to remain competitive.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!7:  Declines in consumer confidence over the last year have been even sharper. All of these positive and negative factors together paint a kind of a Rorschach test, where observers can draw their own conclusions as to the strength of the economy. The End of the Beginning But there is one issue on which our interviewees agree: The exis- tential risk for the real estate economy right now is that Fed action in response to persistent inflation will tip us into a recession, says a senior partner with a leading advisory firm. But can the Federal Reserve Bank tame inflation without breaking the economy? Moderating inflation rates this summer led many to believe that the worst was over and that the Fed could soon ease up its con- tractionary monetary policy. Indeed, the consensus of experts we interviewed this summer was that the Fed would cease tightening by the end of 2022 and start cutting rates again in mid-2023. That sentiment now appears optimistic. Inflation is going to be a little stickier than people think, said an investment banking executive we interviewed during the summer, whose views turned out to be more prescient. Sentiment started changing in late August when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell gave his annual speech to fellow central bankers affirming the Fed view that infla- tion is not nearly under control, jolting markets. Any remaining doubt about that was quashed by the official Fed commentary accompanying their September rate announcement projecting that rates would keep rising through 2023. As Winston Churchill famously cautioned after the British army won a critical WWII battle, the victory marked not the end, not even the beginning of the end, but, possibly, the end of the beginning. 4 Higher for Longer With interest rates headed higher for longer, the risk of a deeper, full-fledged recession is rising, according to a grow- ing consensus of economists. In an August 2022 survey by the National Association of Business Economics, only a quarter of economists were even somewhat confident that the Fed could bring down inflation to its target range without causing a recession. Worrying signs out of Europe in early autumn and expectations of soaring heating bills this coming winter add to the gloomy global economic outlook.;\n\nreal_estate_index:global-real-estate-markets-2023.pdf-!0: Top 10 questions for real estate markets in 2023 December 2022 What lies ahead? UBS Asset Management Weve narrowed it down to A year ago, the world remained in the grips of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Omicron variant had just emerged. 12 months on and the pandemic has largely subsided, only to be replaced by a brutal war in Ukraine and inflation reaching multi-decade highs. This prompted central banks to make aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022, with more expected in 2023, along with a mild recession in the economy. Looking back to our 2022 predictions, in general they proved prescient. We expected hybrid working to weigh on the office market and that the polarization between the best and worst assets would continue, which has been the case. We expected retail capital values to bottom out, which they had started to, but are now likely to be impacted by weakening consumer spending. We said that property investors would no longer be able to rely on market-driven yield compression to drive returns, which has certainly proved accurate as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. In 2023, the environment for real estate looks set to be more challenging, with headwinds coming both from higher interest rates and a weaker economy, which will impact on occupier demand. Against this backdrop, we look at 10 key questions for real estate investors at the turn of the year and how we would approach them. We address ESG questions in our separate publication. Page 2 of 8 Our research team gives answers to some key questions facing real estate investors. To start with, we look at whether real estate prices currently fully reflect the move to higher interest rates and what prospects are for the market going forward. We also highlight opportunities for investors in the current environment, and what their strategy can be. We discuss how they can position their portfolios, and which sectors we think are the most defensive. We then look at prospects for the life sciences sector against a backdrop of slower VC funding. This follows a period of strong growth in the sector and a lot of investor interest.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, the US real estate market transitioned into a phase of stabilization post a remarkable expansion cycle, from 2010 through 2022, commencing with the Federal Reserve's decision to increase interest rates.

In Japan, yield curve control comes at the cost of a weak yen. If the Bank of Japan (BoJ) remains committed to keeping interest rates near zero, currency intervention, such as yen-buying to prevent further depreciation, could be on the table again. However, currency intervention has rarely been successful absent the cooperation from other central banks. Any changes to the yield control approach are likely to come after BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kurodas term concludes in April 2023.

Will the downturn be steep or shallow? Long or short in duration?  Longer term, will inflation become endemic, remaining sticky at a higher level than observed in recent decades? There are reasons for optimism. Labor markets across developed economies are in almost universally good health. Some of the initial triggers of this inflationary episode, such as supply chain pressures, seem to be resolving. Household and corporate balance sheets are reasonably healthy, although income statements are being hit by higher debt service costs wherever borrowing costs are not fixed. The typical culprit for a prolonged economic downturn is a balance sheet recession, as during the Global Financial Crisis, but the conditions for such a prolonged slump do not appear to be met in most segments of the global economy. Real estate fundamentals remain healthy and vacancy rates are low across many property sectors. Meanwhile, expectations for subdued long-run inflation remain in place, with long-run breakeven inflation rates implied by the market suggesting only a moderate increase from prior levels n o z i r o h r a e y - 0 1 r e v O ( 3.5 3.0 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 -0.;\n\nreal_estate_index:bouwinvest_international-market-outlook_2023-2025-1.pdf-!8:  The country remains politically divided after the mid-term elections in November 2022 and polarisation is increasing, leading to potentially volatile policy making.

Both also enter 2023 with economies that are still growing and real estate fundamentals largely in balance. There are challenges, but the medium- to long-term outlook remains brighter than the outlook for the near-term. Real estate investors need strategies that are resilient to an expected volatile environment in 2023 and take advantage of the opportunities emerging from volatility. Stubbornly high inflation The root cause of market challenges heading into 2023 is elevated inflation. The US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada have both made lowering inflation their top priority, but it remains stubbornly high in both markets. This led to policy rates increasing from effectively zero to over four percent by year end. The increase in policy rates has been mirrored in long-term rates and in real estate borrowing rates. The impact has been a dramatic shift in the direction of property values, from a rapid rise in 2021 and early 2022, to a fall in the second half of 2022.

In reaction, the Ministry of Finance intervened in the FX market for the first time since 1998 to stabilize the currency. Page 4 of 8 The other would focus on fundamentals, and argue that even at a lower entry yield the potential for income growth over the investment period can mitigate some of the value depreciation from rising rates. We would side with the second argument. First, risk should define the yield. This means that assets with a higher risk profile will need to adjust to an even higher yield to maintain a risk premium over more core assets. And second, in a period of high inflation, the value of the income of an asset will erode unless it can generate rental growth. Higher yielding assets generally come from sectors with weak occupational demand, hence the risk of void periods and negative rental growth are much higher, particularly during a period of economic stress. Sectors including life sciences, student accommodation, cold storage logistics and self- storage where there are strong structural drivers to support rental growth, are expected to see the greatest value protection. This was welcome news for markets. While unlikely to change the JPY direction, we take comfort that both the government and the BoJ are on the same page. First, this helps to buy time until the US Fed softens its hawkish stance. Second, there is also a positive implication that the next BoJ governor due to be appointed in April 2023 will not deviate materially. To be clear, an exit from the ultra-loose policy is possible in the medium-term. However, it will most likely be done in a gradual manner. For 2023, at least, the current policy should stay and the chances are even higher now that the peak of global inflation and interest rates are drawing close.

LOOKING AHEAD  The relentless math of higher interest rates will continue to weigh heavily on real estate values, at least until interest rates stabilize as inflation begins to subside. The bid- ask spread for private real estate should eventually close and transactions will resume in earnest at a rebased level.  In the meantime, investment styles that are less sensitive to volatility in values should be contemplated, such as floating-rate lending with a comfortable cushion from lower loan-to-value ratios. Debt investment can be attractive at times of uncertainty, as investors tilt toward contractually certain income and away from an uncertain upside. Portfolio aggregation strategies with smaller asset sizes that lend themselves to averaging-in with diversified timing of entry points represent another way to cope with volatile and uncertain values.  The inputs to the math are not changing to the same degree in every part of the world. Wherever rate spikes are less intense, or the prospects for rental growth are clearest, transaction activity and prices have been less impacted.  In addition to debt costs, investors should also consider the trajectory of cash flows, which depend on economic fundamentals and real estate occupier market conditions. The differential prospects for real estate cash flows are the subject of the next section.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!44:   Tightening financial conditions, especially in South Korea and Australia, could create opportunities for higher return strategies.

LOOKING AHEAD  The math of rising interest rates in many Asia Pacific markets is expected to weigh on returns. In this environment, we recommend going back to basics. Supply-demand dynamics are critical in the context of a slowing economy with rising tenant operating costs. Market, submarket and asset selection are key, even in the favored sectors.

The growth of e-commerce is expected to slow, however, due to the fading pandemic and an expected economic recession. We expect the volume of new leasing transactions to be more sluggish than in the exceptionally strong years of 2020 and 2021. E-commerce giant Amazon, the largest corporate user of logistics space in the U. S. has indicated that it will sublease a significant part (10) of its warehouse space.;\n\nreal_estate_index:bouwinvest_international-market-outlook_2023-2025-1.pdf-!16:  Q2 2022 valuations put capital values of prime logistics assets in the APAC area 5 above Q4 2021 levels, but a turning point is expected in the second half of 2022. A decline of around 5 is forecast for 2023 due to stable net yields in Japan. Excluding Japan, the capital value decrease is expected to be closer to 7.5 in that year. Stabilization is anticipated to occur in 2024- 2025, with capital growth averaging 1 per annum for the region as a whole during this period. Bouwinvest Outlook 2023-2025 26 Asia Pacific Retail The shopping centre market has also been pressured in the APAC region, but bricks-and-mortar retail in Asia appears to be more resilient relatively speaking than in other parts of the world. First, there is less shopping centre space per head in (emerging) Asian markets than in the U. S. or Europe. Second, the growing middle class in Asia, together with rising wages, are boosting consumer spending and (online) retail sales. Third, Asia has been quick to adopt omni-channel retailing - combining a broad online product offering with high-standard in-store customer service experience - and to include food beverage, entertainment and leisure in its facilities. Modern Asian shopping centres are, moreover, generally built as part of a mixed-use scheme including residential, office and hotels, which ensures footfall and embeds the centre into the community. Finally, climate change and more humid weather conditions have turned shopping centres into preferred meeting places in Hong Kong and Singapore, for example. The region is, however, far more heterogeneous than North America or Europe and some cities and markets, for example in Australia, are experiencing excess supply of shopping centre space. This market has seen values decline by approximately 15 to 30 between the peak of the market in Q1 2019 and Q2 2022. A fall in the number of Chinese tourists has also affected retail turnover figures in APAC, especially Hong Kong. Even if the number of tourists from mainland China do pick up, softening economic growth and pressure on Chinas real estate market could lead to a decrease in spending.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, the rate of depreciation in the capital value of prime logistics properties in the last quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 is expected to be around 7-8% according to .\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

S. commercial property markets actually embarked on a remarkable run, with some of the strongest returns, rent growth, and price appreciation rates ever recorded. Not every property type, however: hotels endured their worst and most sustained downturn in memory, while offices suffered an unprecedented and significant cut in usage of space. And not every market: some of the nations strongest gateway mar- kets, like New York City and San Francisco, experienced sharp outflows of residents, businesses, and tenants of all types. But overall and across much of the United States, property markets far outperformed expectations and historical norms. And now, more than two years on, property investors and managers are learning anew that whopping growth and profits eventually fall back to eartha reversion to the mean, to use finance jargon, or simply normalizing, as numerous industry experts we interviewed put it. Some looming market adjustments will be cyclical due to the weakening economic conditions that most economists and real estate professionals expect, while others represent more of a return to normalcy after all the pandemic-fueled market distortions. These market reversions will take several forms: prices of most assets are declining as cap rates rise and transaction volumes fall from record levels, while rent gains for others are merely moderating as demand returns to more sustainable levels. Perhaps the biggest surprise is that these reversals of fortune are hitting favored property sectors like multifamily and indus- trial. That does not necessarily mean the market corrections will be painful. In many cases, recent losses in property value will only trim already healthy gains. But many indicators suggest that the (really) good times may be over, at least for a while. Housing Set to Cool A finance executive with one national homebuilder told us, Were still selling. Its just not at the pace that it was selling before the last two years, which was a pace that you dont typi- cally see. So, the markets are more normalizing.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!13:  More than half believe that capitalization rates are heading up next year and returns are coming down, primarily due to rising interest rates and cost of capital, which was the top economic concern voiced in our survey. After more than a decade of lower for longer, the Fed is finally normalizing interest rates closer to historical levels. Those rising interest rates are already driving up debt costs and thus the costs to acquire and develop property, reducing leveraged returns. At the same time, the federal government is done with providing stimulus, indirectly reducing tenant demand for space. Unlike in the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and during the pandemic, nobodys coming to the rescue, and now we got to take our medicine, and here it comes, says the head of research for an investment management firm. Thus, the government is turning off both the monetary and fiscal spigots that had been support- ing commercial real estate and the economy overall. The head of a development company summarized it like this: I feel like weve been on a little bit of a sugar high with this stimu- lus and cheap debt. Theres going to be a slowdown. Theres got to be this normalization. So, what does that mean? I think its going to be a little bouncy. Its going to be a little bit turbulent. But then we bottom out, and we start back into growth. 2.  Still, Weve Changed Some  The pandemic forced structural shifts in how and where we live, work, and recreate in ways that seem destinated to endure.  Online spending is receding from its pandemic peaks but is not likely to revert to pre-pandemic levels. Business travel is unlikely to recover to pre-COVID levels for at least several years, meaning business hotels, fine dining, and conference facilities will continue to face challenges.  The greatest changes may be in how and where we work. The impact on office use and leasing is still evolving, and a significant share of the existing stock may need to be reposi- tioned to remain competitive.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!19:  One of our key themes last year was Everyone Wants In, reflecting the deep and wide investor demand for just about every type of real estate, except central business district (CBD) office and regional malls. Sales volumes jumped to over $800 billion in 2021, according to MSCI Real Assetsalmost double the depressed total in the first pandemic year of 2020 and nearly one-third more than the prior $600 billion record reached in 2019. The surge continued into 2022, with sales volumes in the first half of the year up 38 percent over the same period last year, as even the sharp rise in interest rates did little to dampen transaction volumes. But these recent volumes do not tell the whole storyand the story they do tell may be misleading as to where property markets seem to be heading. Discussions with numerous participants from all corners of the industry confirm that many investors have moved to the sidelinesor to other types of assets like equities and bonds. Indeed, the recent surge may well reflect a last gasp to get deals done before the expected increase in interest rates. Fewer Investors Fewer investors and lenders will be providing capital for assets, according to this years Emerging Trends survey: expectations of availability declined for every one of the 13 equity and debt capital sources. Over the past decade, CRE markets benefited from a substantial capital inflow as alternative investment classes have gained wider acceptance and real estate offered compel- ling risk-adjusted returns. Now, some of those inflows look to reverse. Investor interest is still healthy, but not what it was. Instead of seven or 10 competing offers for sale, theres now two or three, which I think thats normal, says the head of an investment firm. Thats normalizing, too. Several forces look to restrict investor demand, starting with the lower expected returns discussed in our Normalizing trend. Rising interest rates are making acquisition and construc- tion debt more expensive, just when operating incomes seem destined to slide as the economy weakens in the forecasted downturn. Indeed, the prospect of lower income and higher costs is breaking deals, as buyers either seek price breaks or pull out altogether.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!14:  Even as property markets begin to normalize in many ways after some of the disruptions of the past few years, we wont be resum- ing our former lives in some key respects. The pandemic forced structural shifts in how and where we live, work, and recreate in ways that seem destinated to endure at least at some level, even if less extreme than our behaviors during the peak of COVID. Many activities have already returned to pre-pandemic levels, of course, especially those involving socializing. Americans are back to attending concerts and sporting events, and leisure travelers, at least, have returned to the nations roads and airways. Meanwhile, we are obviously tired of exercising and cooking alone at home, so gym memberships have returned to historical levels while restaurant sales are back above grocer- ies, as they had been since 2015 until COVID shut down dining establishments. Yet many other activitiesand how we use spaceseem unlikely to return to the old ways. The pandemic changed us. Says a director of an investment management firm, People are looking to achieve their lifestyle choices more quickly. Theyre less focused on their employer and more focused on their per- sonal lifestyle. And that is changing how apartments are being viewed, how single-family residential is being viewed, how office is being utilized, and where corporations are heading. In-Store versus Online Shopping Much of our spending shifted online during the pandemic. The e-commerce share of retail sales shot up from 13 percent in 2019 to a peak of 20 percent during the initial national lockdown. That drained a lot of spending from physical retailers and squeezed the nations shopping centers. The online share inevitably waned as the economy reopened and more consumers felt comfortable shopping in stores again. But dont expect online spending to drop down to pre-pandemic levels, say many experts we interviewed. While shoppers initially resorted to e-commerce due to safety concerns or simply because the stores were not even opendid we really live through that?they still shop online today because of its other benefits, including greater convenience, selection, and price advantages. Thus, the share we spend online remains highly elevated at just under 18 percent, nearly five percentage points above the rate before COVID.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, according to industry experts, the real estate market has experienced a return to the mean or normalization after the COVID lockdown.\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

The willingness and ability to invest large amounts of money in maintaining health is therefore correspondingly strong. An ever increasing number of people worldwide al- so have access to medical care. Life Sciences essentially consist of a combination of various scientific disciplines such as biology, chemistry, medicine and pharmaceuticals. In turn, the main activity of the biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and medical technology segments in focus he- re is research into living organisms. Life Sciences are associated with the develop- ment of economically successful products for human health rather than with funda- mental research. In Germany, biotechnology moved centre stage and gained additi- onal momentum with the approval of the first Covid vaccine. However, the path to producing a market-ready substance is long and fraught with obstacles. Only a fraction of the substances researched are actually successful. To achieve rapid progress, sufficiently large teams are needed. Growth in the number of jobs in Life Sciences is leading to correspondingly higher demand for properties and investment. According to estimates, more than 300,000 people in more than 2,000 companies are employed in the Life Sciences sector in Germany. Biotechnology is the smallest segment, while pharmaceuticals and medical technology employ signifi- cantly more people. The functions of the properties required range from pure offices via laboratories and pharmaceutical logistics to production plants. From our perspec- tive, this combination of office and laboratory  the lab office  is of particular interest to investors.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!8: 4 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021 2023e 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021 2023e LIFE SCIENCES: FOCUS ON HEALTH Research offices are a niche segment, but also a growth market Staying healthy as you age  who wouldnt want that? In simplified terms, this is the motivation driving the booming Life Sciences sector of the economy, which is resear- ching corresponding solutions. However, classic office premises are not appropriate for companies in this segment. Although office space is required for administrative and management functions, the main focus is on laboratory space used by the biolo- gists, chemists and medical staff who are carrying out the research. This combinati- on - the young lab offices segment - is of increasing interest to investors. What lies behind the lab office trend and what potential does it have? The Covid pandemic is a starting point for a review of this segment. It has not only shifted vaccine development into the public focus, but has also brought into the mainstream concepts such as vulnerable and pre-existing conditions to refer to people at risk of serious cases of Covid 19. Because people are living longer thanks to medical progress, these concepts apply to large sections of the population and not just to a small number of people. In 2021 in Germany more than one fifth of the po- pulation  around 18 million people  had reached the age of 65. However, increa- sed life expectancy has not so far been accompanied by improved fitness levels. In fact the opposite is true. A sedentary lifestyle, high-calorie food, ready meals contai- ning a lot of sugar, and the consumption of alcohol and tobacco have consequences, and considerably increase the risk of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, demen- tia, heart attacks, cancer and strokes. The growing number of older people suffering ill health is also a significant economic factor.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!103:  the realms of personalized and regenerative medicine will continue to scale, revolutionizing the industry. The seeds of growth begin with the research and development activities happening in innovative life-sciences market clusters, where science, technology, institutional support, and funding all meet to drive progress. The most mature market clusters are generating the great- est level of demand and investment activity, but expansion into emerging markets is starting to take firmer hold. As institutions, universities, and local communities invest in the development of innovation communities, talent pipelines, and incubator space for growing startups, more markets will capture the growth of the life-sciences industry. Top clusters have evolved over several decades, but emerg- ing markets planting the seeds of industry infrastructure today will see the benefit over the long term. The convergence of science and technology is happening within innovation com- munities across markets, with pockets of growth emerging in Houston, Boulder, Atlanta, and Dallas, among others. The long-term view on the life-sciences sector is quite posi- tive. The advances in science, the continued flow of capital, and the development of ecosystems in markets outside the core clusters will bolster the industrys steady expansion over the long term. Life Sciences Is a Resilient Long-Term Opportunity Innovation is happening at a more rapid pace than ever before, opening up limitless possibilities for the advance- ment of medical and life sciences. Novel therapies within JLL Continued from page 57. and its effects are strongly felt in the office real estate sector, the report notes. The ultimate impact of WFH on office demand is likely to fall somewhere between the extreme estimates, varying by location and property quality. Demand will be strong in growing markets with rapid job growth, and for A-quality assets. BC-quality assets will see the biggest drop in occupancy and rents. Asking rent growth will remain weak, and expenses will continue to rise, so net income growth will turn negative in properties that are dated or in need of capital improvements.

The Importance of Older Buildings In her classic 1961 urban planning treatise, The Death and Life of Great American Cities, Jane Jacobs elucidates the critical ingredients for a diverse, vibrant city. Among them is one rule that may seem puzzling at first: The district must mingle build- ings that vary in age and condition, including a good proportion of old ones. Why the need for old buildings? Why not all new? If a city area has only new buildings, the enterprises that can exist there are automatically limited to those that can support the high costs of new construction. How boring and monotonous that would be. Jacobs points to all the small local businesses that occupy these older structures that give the neighborhood its diversity and vitality. Although Jacobs doesnt say it precisely, there is another crucial observation regarding the importance of older buildings: so many of them find new life with uses different from their original function. Walk around the bustling old port districts of Montreal or Boston or Portland, Maine, and you will find hundreds of for- mer warehouses that have been repurposed into upscale hotels, cool offices, hip restaurants, and distinctive retail spaces. Conversions are hardly limited to old warehouse districts. Every vibrant downtown is filled with buildings of varying types and vintages that have been converted into new uses. Often the conversions go upstream, as lower-value land uses like ware- houses convert into higher-value uses like office or retail. But the direction is often reversed, with old offices converting into artist space or storage. Lemonade from Lemons Demographic trends and structural demand shifts magnified by the pandemic have rendered countless existing buildings either redundant or obsolete . But manythough not allof these can be either repurposed or upgraded to meet new market standards. The many opportunities include the following: 18  Converting older offices to residential uses, or upgrading them into modern offices, where feasible and supported by the market.  Repurposing excess retail space for other uses or improving with mixed use. And  Scraping buildings to create development land where con- version is not feasible, or where density can be increased, to site new housing.;\n***\n[Submission]: Answer: Mitochondria are organelles found in most cells and are responsible for producing energy for the cell.

Furthermore, with revenue expectations muted, a greater proportion of respondents (33) are planning to cut costs compared to last year, when just 6 planned to make cuts. A RECENT DELOITTE ECONOMICS report offered several scenarios for the near-term outlook in the United States.2 The most likely scenario is that economic growth continues through 2022, though tightening monetary policy, peaking employment growth, and continued energy and food shortages slow this near-term growth trajectory. Inflation would remain high through 2022, but gradually settle around 2 by mid-2023 as demand for goods subsides in favor of services, helping businesses alleviate supply chain issues. The Federal Reserve would raise rates to combat inflation through 2022, but slow rate increases as inflation normalizes. Other, less likely scenarios include: (1) Back to the 1970s (25) where businesses raise prices and wages in lockstep and there is sustained high inflation.

Although campus-level construction figures are often capriciousit is not uncommon to see a huge wave of deliveries followed by years with no constructionthe United States averaged roughly 50,000 new beds per year over the past few years, with relatively little deviation from year to year. But the pandemic bred a lot of uncertainty. And, as a result, fall 2022s expected delivery total will easily be the lowest figure in at least a decade. Not much is expected to change in 2023 either. Despite Positive Signals, Be Aware of Headwinds and Risks Although fall 2022 performance is a welcome sight for industry professionals, external risks and headwinds should not be discounted. For one, inflation remains at its highest level in 40 years. Although there does not appear to be a correlation between rising inflation and increasing missed payments thus far, that does not mean that the broader inflation story should be dismissed.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!75:  inflation, labor shortages in the building trade industries, and the change in Fed policy of higher interest rates are collec- tively affecting plans for new development. Many projects increasingly do not pencil out for reasonable returns. Second, demand is also a tailwind for an ongoing improve- ment in occupancy. Indeed, demand, as measured by the change in occupied inventory or net absorption, was robust in the second quarter of 2022, increasing at its strongest pace ever recorded by NIC MAP Vision except for the post- pandemic boost in demand in the last half of 2021. Since the recovery began in the second quarter of 2021, 78 percent of the units placed back on the market have been reoccupied.

This marked the fifth consecutive quarter in which occupancy did not decline. At 81.4 percent in the second quarter, occu- pancy was 3.4 percentage points above its pandemic-related low of 78.0 percent recorded in the second quarter of 2021 but was 5.8 percentage points below its pre-pandemic level of 87.2 percent in the first quarter of 2020. Outside influencing factors. Looking ahead, several exog- enous factors will influence the strength of net move-ins and demand. These include demographics as well as the following:  The broad performance of the U.

French and Spanish cities posted quarter-on-quarter yield increases of between 15 and 25bps. As risk-free rates are up and expected to remain elevated between 2023 and 2025, we believe office capital values could soften further during the outlook period, and we estimate prime yields in Europe will move out by another 50bps. This would amount to a value loss of around 10 to 15 before stabilization and recovery takes place. Office transaction volumes in Europe already fell by over 20 during Q2 2022 compared with the same year-earlier period. Bouwinvest Outlook 2023-2025 9 Europe Logistics Covid-19 had a surprisingly positive effect on European logistics markets with the accelerated adoption of online shopping more than offsetting the economic turmoil. Now that the pandemic appears to be largely under control, the pace of e-commerce growth has eased, but is still positive and the potential for further expansion remains strong as consumers service expectations continue to evolve and drive demand for logistics properties. reluctance among municipalities to issue land for new logistic space. We expect this latter trend to continue in the coming years, with Germany and France currently showing the most resistance to new greenfield developments. As a result, nominal rental growth, although slowing down, is expected to remain positive during the outlook period at a figure just shy of 3.0 per annum. Global supply chain disruption following the pandemic and ongoing geopolitical tensions are also fuelling a supply chain reconfiguration with a greater emphasis on onshoring over just-in-time. This is boosting domestic demand for logistics real estate and helping to ease wider supply chain pressures. European economic support programmes running until 2027 and totalling 1.1 trillion are expected to provide another boost to the sector. The volume of new supply coming to market is meanwhile decreasing due to both rising construction costs and a Capital values of prime logistics properties are forecast to decline by an average 7-8 in Q4 2022 compared with Q4 2021 levels.;\n\nreal_estate_index:bouwinvest_international-market-outlook_2023-2025-1.pdf-!16:  Q2 2022 valuations put capital values of prime logistics assets in the APAC area 5 above Q4 2021 levels, but a turning point is expected in the second half of 2022. A decline of around 5 is forecast for 2023 due to stable net yields in Japan. Excluding Japan, the capital value decrease is expected to be closer to 7.5 in that year. Stabilization is anticipated to occur in 2024- 2025, with capital growth averaging 1 per annum for the region as a whole during this period. Bouwinvest Outlook 2023-2025 26 Asia Pacific Retail The shopping centre market has also been pressured in the APAC region, but bricks-and-mortar retail in Asia appears to be more resilient relatively speaking than in other parts of the world. First, there is less shopping centre space per head in (emerging) Asian markets than in the U. S. or Europe. Second, the growing middle class in Asia, together with rising wages, are boosting consumer spending and (online) retail sales. Third, Asia has been quick to adopt omni-channel retailing - combining a broad online product offering with high-standard in-store customer service experience - and to include food beverage, entertainment and leisure in its facilities. Modern Asian shopping centres are, moreover, generally built as part of a mixed-use scheme including residential, office and hotels, which ensures footfall and embeds the centre into the community. Finally, climate change and more humid weather conditions have turned shopping centres into preferred meeting places in Hong Kong and Singapore, for example. The region is, however, far more heterogeneous than North America or Europe and some cities and markets, for example in Australia, are experiencing excess supply of shopping centre space. This market has seen values decline by approximately 15 to 30 between the peak of the market in Q1 2019 and Q2 2022. A fall in the number of Chinese tourists has also affected retail turnover figures in APAC, especially Hong Kong. Even if the number of tourists from mainland China do pick up, softening economic growth and pressure on Chinas real estate market could lead to a decrease in spending.;\n\nreal_estate_index:bouwinvest_international-market-outlook_2023-2025-1.pdf-!10:  Prime office values at East and West Coast locations dropped by over 5 in H1 2022 and we expect this trend to continue in the second half of the year with a further decline of roughly 10-15. Sustainability is not completely top of mind on the U. S. political agenda which is focused more on social inclusion. The corporate and international investor community is, however, acknowledging the need for more sustainable buildings. Individual cities rather than the national government are leading the U. S. on this topic. Prime offices in the sunbelt cities appear to be better positioned due to migration patterns and rising employment and the drop in values is expected to be confined to around 5 over 2022. During the outlook period we expect East and West Coast office values to shed roughly an additional 10 while pricing in the Sunbelt cities and Miami will, for the most part, remain relatively steady. Yields are expected to move out by around 30bps over the outlook period. Bouwinvest Outlook 2023-2025 17 North America Logistics Retail The sector continues to be buoyed by fundamental demand drivers such as e-commerce, supply chain reconfiguration and government (infrastructure) investment programmes. Rental growth is therefore expected to remain positive during the outlook period, rising approximately 3 on average per annum during 2023-2025. The shopping centre market in North America was hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic which accelerated the already visible negative trend. A partial recovery took place in 2022, but the outlook period is expected to be challenging due to high inflation, low consumer confidence and a weaker economic outlook. The growth of e-commerce is expected to slow, however, due to the fading pandemic and an expected economic recession. We expect the volume of new leasing transactions to be more sluggish than in the exceptionally strong years of 2020 and 2021. E-commerce giant Amazon, the largest corporate user of logistics space in the U. S. has indicated that it will sublease a significant part (10) of its warehouse space.;\n\nreal_estate_index:bouwinvest_international-market-outlook_2023-2025-1.pdf-!6:  A steeper fall is expected to take place in most markets in 2023, with values potentially shedding another 10. This should be seen as a correction rather than a downturn, however, as capital values are still significantly higher than they were two years ago. The keenly priced yields for prime UK and German logistics will most likely soften first, with a relatively larger effect on their capital values in the coming period. Yields in other European markets have not tightened quite as sharply but are also expected to ease in response. Bouwinvest Outlook 2023-2025 10 Europe Retail The retail sector is still recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic and the accelerated penetration of e-commerce. Online retail sales as a percentage of total retail turnover currently averages 12 in Europe and this figure is expected to rise to approximately 21 by 2027. Consumer confidence, meanwhile, is at an all-time low due to sky-high inflation and declining consumer purchasing power. Market rents are therefore expected to remain under pressure for the time being. The gap between contractually agreed rents, which are rising in tandem with consumer price index (CPI) increases, and market rents is widening. The redevelopment and repurposing of outdated or obsolete retail properties continue apace. Capital values are expected to weaken further, despite signals that the bottom of the market may have already been reached. Neighbourhood and food- anchored retail centres (convenience) in growing catchment areas are better placed and continue to perform well. Niches Institutional real estate investors are expected to continue their gradual and managed shift from core, traditional real estate sec- tors to more investments in niche and growth market segments. The European healthcare market, for example, is viewed as being fundamentally well-positioned due to ageing societies and increased life expectancy in most European countries. Supply shortfalls characterise both the senior housing market and nursing homes . The market is becoming increasingly professional through the financial support of institutional investors and the growing experience and expertise of local operators, pointing to enormous potential for investment opportunities in this niche segment. Long leases offer inflation protection while the yield gap between regular residential investments and senior housing, in particular, is still quite significant, offering opportunities for future value growth.;\n***\n[Submission]: Answer: According to  and , the average capital value decline of prime logistics properties in Q4 2022 compared to Q4 2021 is expected to be around 7-8.\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

The bill contains a flood of rules and regulations. For example, new buildings are to be emission-free and have a photovoltaic system from 2028. In addition, emissions are to be calculated over the life cycle for new buildings. For renovations, photovoltaic systems are to be mandatory from 2032. Oil and gas heating systems are to be replaced in major renovations. The recently presented national bill to amend the Building Energy Act pursues similar goals. From 2024, heating systems in new buildings and renovations are to be based on 65 renewable energies. In addition, the German government plans to make it mandatory to replace heating systems that are 30 years old. The 2014 Energy Saving Ordinance already contained a similar provision, and since 2015 there has been an obligation to replace constant-temperature boilers. The modern boilers significantly reduced consumption, which often made the investment worthwhile. With the replacement now required in favor of a heat pump or a district heating, rapid amortization is likely to be difficult. An exchange obligation without generous national support might meet substantial resistances. Often, however, little attention is paid to the numerous exceptions in both the European and the national draft legislation. The European text allows exceptions for listed buildings, and national governments can also make exceptions to the obligation to install photovoltaic systems. In addition, there are several formulations such as if this is technically and economically feasible. The national draft law contains the word if possible. So there should be exceptions. Owners over 80 years of age can stick with fossil-fuel heating systems when replacing their heating systems. In addition, the legislation provides for hardship provisions and funding opportunities. These details show that the legislator is aware of the enormous challenge. The Modernization Package for Climate Protection and Planning Acceleration passed at the end of March also takes this into account. Greater openness to technology was agreed. For example, not only heat pumps are to be permitted, but also infrared and hybrid heating systems, such as a bivalent heat pump with a gas condensing boiler.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2023_Housing_market_outlook__Price_dip_and_interes.pdf-!43:  In view of the numerous pro and con arguments and the scant data available, it remains unclear from an analytical perspective whether the 6 million target will be achieved in 2030. Not only supply bottlenecks but also insufficient demand could stand in the way of achieving the target. The introduction and enforcement of regulatory laws are politically explosive. Moreover, a simple subsidy is unlikely to close a potential demand gap. Prices for air-to-water heat pumps have roughly doubled in the last 15 years. The state subsidy therefore probably flowed primarily to the manufacturers of heat pumps and not to the property owners. In addition to the replacement of heating systems, the focus is on the building envelope. Although the Building Energy Act provides regulations for the thermal transmittance coefficient, which measures a building's heat output to the outside, these typically reflect the current technology standards of the building components. Thus, the legal requirements are much less challenging than the heat pump target. 5.3 Price differences between low and high emission buildings Low-emission buildings arguably already command price premiums. For example, in the summer of 2021 price indices for existing and new homes were similar. By contrast, in February 2023 there was a 14 difference. Taking into account energy-related refurbishment costs for existing properties is likely to explain the divergence. During the housing boom the state of renovation and the energy certificates played a much smaller role. Today, properties that have not been refurbished or have been refurbished to a minor extent are regularly traded at a discount. In the long term, the discount is likely to increase. On the supply side, the shortage of labor and skilled workers is likely to intensify over the decade as a whole. As a result, the ambitious new construction and refurbishment targets will be difficult to achieve. On the demand side, the rise in energy prices and the consideration of the costs of climate change are likely to lead to a shift away from buildings with high emissions and toward low-emission buildings. The CO2 tax is already making energy costs more expensive. In the next few years, the EU taxonomy will require larger companies and institutional investors to publish their ESG footprint annually. The way companies generate profits will thus come into focus.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!103:  the realms of personalized and regenerative medicine will continue to scale, revolutionizing the industry. The seeds of growth begin with the research and development activities happening in innovative life-sciences market clusters, where science, technology, institutional support, and funding all meet to drive progress. The most mature market clusters are generating the great- est level of demand and investment activity, but expansion into emerging markets is starting to take firmer hold. As institutions, universities, and local communities invest in the development of innovation communities, talent pipelines, and incubator space for growing startups, more markets will capture the growth of the life-sciences industry. Top clusters have evolved over several decades, but emerg- ing markets planting the seeds of industry infrastructure today will see the benefit over the long term. The convergence of science and technology is happening within innovation com- munities across markets, with pockets of growth emerging in Houston, Boulder, Atlanta, and Dallas, among others. The long-term view on the life-sciences sector is quite posi- tive. The advances in science, the continued flow of capital, and the development of ecosystems in markets outside the core clusters will bolster the industrys steady expansion over the long term. Life Sciences Is a Resilient Long-Term Opportunity Innovation is happening at a more rapid pace than ever before, opening up limitless possibilities for the advance- ment of medical and life sciences.

The ultimate impact of WFH on office demand is likely to fall somewhere between the extreme estimates, varying by location and property quality. Demand will be strong in growing markets with rapid job growth, and for A-quality assets. BC-quality assets will see the biggest drop in occupancy and rents. Asking rent growth will remain weak, and expenses will continue to rise, so net income growth will turn negative in properties that are dated or in need of capital improvements.

CO2 emissions are now to be taken into account to a greater extent in aggregated form across all sectors. Since emissions reductions in the building sector are relatively expensive, a missed target is more likely to be accepted here than in other sectors. According to the modernization package, however, the sector targets remain in place. The long-term target of a climate-neutral building stock in 2045 was also confirmed. Thus, only temporarily too high CO2 emissions may be accepted. Consequently, the pressure to refurbish remains high. 14 April 21, 2023 Germany Monitor 2023 Housing market outlook Working time for installation of heaters 34 SFHSingle house, MFHMulti-family house, HPHeating pump Source: ITG, Klimaneutraler Gebudebestand 2045 Labour market: Rising lack of employees 35 Duration of vacant positions in days 250 200 150 100 50 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 342 Heating and sanitary 321 Building construction 322 Civil engineering Source: Federal Employment Agency 5.2 Expansion targets for district heating and heat pumps require substantial conversion of existing buildings The government-commissioned study Building Strategy Climate Neutrality 2045, published in 2022, describes the steps needed to achieve climate goals.

Roughly, from 2015 to 2020, the number of connections increased by 100,000 annually, so it will take roughly a threefold increase in annual output, most of which will come from civil engineering.

Since this technology has been tried and tested over decades, the goal could still be achieved. The low number of working days required to connect buildings to the district heating network is equally optimistic.;\n***\n[Submission]: Answer: Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use light energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. During photosynthesis, light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll molecules in the plant's leaves and converted into chemical energy. This energy is then used to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. The glucose is used by the plant for energy and the oxygen is released into the atmosphere .\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

Many of the changes were relatively minor, and nine of the 10 highest-rated markets last year repeated this year . But there were some material changes over the year as about a quarter of markets moved up or down in rankings by at least 10 places. And consistent with our normal- izing trend, many of the markets near the top of the standings last year have fallen this year, while many previously lower- rate markets have risen: More than half (11) of the 20-highest rated markets in last years survey fell in the rankings this year, although almost all by less than 10 places. Meanwhile, some of the markets that were found lower in the rankings in prior years are now finding more support. Thirteen of the 20-lowest rated markets in last years survey rose in the rankings this year. Some Like It Hot Despite the modest drop in the Supernova ratings this year, Emerging Trends survey respondents still see the best prospects in Sun Belt metropolitan areas, which have been growing over time. The number of Sun Belt markets among the top 20 markets for overall prospects has increased from 10 in 2011 to 14 in each of the past two years. At the same time, the number of markets in cold-weather climates in the Northeast and Midwest has declined from five to just two .

This group includes the markets sur- rounding high-cost CBDs in Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, San Francisco, and Washington, D. C. Though most are subur- ban in character, some are more urban. Moreover, several are or contain metropolitan statistical areas in their own right. Many of these markets benefited from the out-migration from their neighboring CBDs during the pandemic, and their prospects have improved somewhat in the eyes of survey respondents. But here, too, there is a diversity in trends as seven of the 12 markets improved this year and five declined. Most of the improvement was registered in the New York metropolitan area, while the declining markets are mainly in California. Exhibit 3-9 U. S.

The relative rankings of the markets tracked in Emerging Trends changed meaningfully this year as eco- nomic conditions in the United States appear to be heading for a slide. Nonetheless, many Magnet markets remain among the most favored, even if some of them have slipped a bit this year. At the same time, real estate professionals appear more willing to consider some markets that had been less in favor in recent years. The perpetual search for new opportunities ensures con- stant flux in how markets are viewed over time. Grouping the Markets After comprehensively reorganizing how we group our 80 geo- graphic markets two years ago and a lighter refresh last year, we are continuing with the same groupings this year and turn our focus to how the various groups and some key markets have changed since our previous report. Additional demo- graphic and economic data and more detailed descriptions of these market groups are available online, as listed at the end of this chapter. Magnets Magnet markets are migration destinations for both people and companies, and most are growing more quickly than the U. S. average in terms of both population and jobs. These metro areas are also the preferred markets for investors and builders, with the highest average Overall Real Estate Prospects ratings of any group in the Emerging Trends survey by a wide margin. Collectively, these markets account for almost one-third of the population base in the Emerging Trends coverage universe, the second-largest group in Markets to Watch. Super Sun Belt. These markets are large and diverse but still affordable, forming powerhouse economies that attract a wide range of businesses. Despite their large population bases, most are among the fastest-growing markets in the United States. Moreover, their economic performance has been solid through thick and thin. Though every market lost jobs during the pan- demic recession, recovery has been much quicker and more complete in the Super Sun Belt markets. These metro areas collectively have the highest average rating of any subgroup, as it did last year. 18-Hour Cities.;\n***\n[Submission]: Thirteen of the 20-lowest rated markets in last years survey rose in the rankings this year.\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

Reinventing markets are eastern and midwestern cities seeking to modernize their economic base. Many were manufacturing centers and are now moving to a more sustain- able mix of education, health care, and technology. Though the economic rebound in most of these markets lags the national recovery, the federal governments stimulus programs have helped cushion the downturn.

UBS Asset Management Weve narrowed it down to A year ago, the world remained in the grips of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Omicron variant had just emerged. 12 months on and the pandemic has largely subsided, only to be replaced by a brutal war in Ukraine and inflation reaching multi-decade highs. This prompted central banks to make aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022, with more expected in 2023, along with a mild recession in the economy. Looking back to our 2022 predictions, in general they proved prescient. We expected hybrid working to weigh on the office market and that the polarization between the best and worst assets would continue, which has been the case. We expected retail capital values to bottom out, which they had started to, but are now likely to be impacted by weakening consumer spending. We said that property investors would no longer be able to rely on market-driven yield compression to drive returns, which has certainly proved accurate as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. In 2023, the environment for real estate looks set to be more challenging, with headwinds coming both from higher interest rates and a weaker economy, which will impact on occupier demand. Against this backdrop, we look at 10 key questions for real estate investors at the turn of the year and how we would approach them. We address ESG questions in our separate publication. Page 2 of 8 Our research team gives answers to some key questions facing real estate investors. To start with, we look at whether real estate prices currently fully reflect the move to higher interest rates and what prospects are for the market going forward. We also highlight opportunities for investors in the current environment, and what their strategy can be.

We are reluctant to make investment decisions based solely on a view of future interest rates, but acknowledge that real estate pricing is linked to future interest rates. Given this dynamic, we recommend investors consider a range of interest rate scenarios . Interest rate increases and the relentless math Each time interest rates ticked higher since the GFC, the question of when higher debt costs would impact real estate values was asked. It was a speculative question, with the underlying assumption that rate increases thus far had not yet impacted values. Regardless of the answer then, it became very clear in 2022 that the relentless math of higher borrowing rates was having an impact on leveraged returns and asset values . The boost investors were getting from borrowing has shifted to a drag on a cash basis, but with unleveraged internal rates of return generally above borrowing rates, leverage is still marginally accretive on a total return basis. However, with less lift from borrowing, leveraged buyers are largely out of the market . Higher borrowing rates are a function of both higher indices and increased borrowing spreads. Lending volume is down significantly and lenders are becoming more conservative. The supply of debt capital from large money center banks is down due to large positions taken in the first half of 2022 coupled with stress testing. The Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (CMBS) market continues to be impacted by volatility and life companies are looking into 2023 until fresh allocations become available.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Deloitte 2023 Commercial Real Estate Outlook.pdf-!3: 3 Of course, those expectations came in the wake of a very challenging 2020. Furthermore, with revenue expectations muted, a greater proportion of respondents (33) are planning to cut costs compared to last year, when just 6 planned to make cuts. A RECENT DELOITTE ECONOMICS report offered several scenarios for the near-term outlook in the United States.2 The most likely scenario is that economic growth continues through 2022, though tightening monetary policy, peaking employment growth, and continued energy and food shortages slow this near-term growth trajectory. Inflation would remain high through 2022, but gradually settle around 2 by mid-2023 as demand for goods subsides in favor of services, helping businesses alleviate supply chain issues. The Federal Reserve would raise rates to combat inflation through 2022, but slow rate increases as inflation normalizes. Other, less likely scenarios include: (1) Back to the 1970s (25) where businesses raise prices and wages in lockstep and there is sustained high inflation. (2) COVID-19 relapse (5) in which vaccines become ineffective, and lockdowns are again imposed. And (3) Next recession (15), triggered by overly aggressive tightening of monetary policy as governments attempt to tame inflation. Regardless of which scenario comes to fruition, the 2023 Deloitte real estate outlook survey reveals that concerns about the economy are top of mind for most global real estate leaders as they prepare for the remainder of 2022 and 2023 . Revenue expectations for the full year are mixed among those surveyed, and generally more muted than last year. While 40 of 4 FIGURE 1 When asked to forecast 2022 revenues, respondents were much less optimistic than they were last year 2023 vs.;\n\nreal_estate_index:global-real-estate-markets-2023.pdf-!2:  Overall, we think that global capital values will bottom out in the second half of 2023, with the timing dependent upon how the economy fairs and a longer adjustment possible. 1 According to MSCI Global Quarterly Property Index and FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Index in USD. For example, owners who are forced to sell assets because they are unable to refinance debt or need to sell for other reasons, such as generating liquidity quickly. In such situations, sellers may be willing to accept below-market prices, or indeed have to, in order to facilitate a sale. For investors wanting to deploy capital now, holding off for a few months as pricing adjusts is probably the best strategy. Given the higher interest rate environment, we also think that floating rate real estate debt is an attractive way to achieve strong inflation protected returns and generate a good income return from real estate. Finally, looking across the globe, another potential opportunity for investors in 2023 is Japan, due to accretive hedging gains for investment into this market. Indeed, investors need to be mindful of large differences in monetary policy as interest rate differentials between countries determine the cost of hedging. Currently, Japan is particularly attractive on an after-hedging basis, since interest rates there are lower than in other markets. Page 3 of 8 What opportunities exist for investors in 2023? Which markets and sectors are the most defensive? There are two schools of thought in answering this question. One would argue that higher yielding assets offer greater value protection as they have a wider spread to the rising bond yields, and in some cases leverage can still be accretive. Yes, we think so. Japans economic recovery has lagged. The labor market improved in 2022, but is still soft relative to 2019. October inflation at 3.6 was the highest in four decades, but modest versus other countries. The pressure was also largely imported while domestic inflation stayed benign. In that context, maintaining the loose monetary policy appears the right thing to do. However, something has to give due to this diverging policy stance versus elsewhere.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, property values had an effect in midyear 2022.

But for now, the height- ened uncertainty is leading many players to stay on the sidelines as they wait to see where the market, particularly when it comes to pricing and valuations, settles. One interviewee noted their cautious approach when they said that they were sticking to the fairway, not trying to clear the trees and skip the dogleg, when it comes to deployment decisions. Cost Escalations amid Supply Chain Challenges and Labor Shortages On top of concerns about the capital markets are supply chain shortages and delays as well as significant increases in costs for labor and materials. Labor issues have been a challenge for some time, but rising costs and shortages of inputs including for key materials like steelhave added to the pressures. According to Statistics Canada, residential building costs were up 22.6 percent on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter of 2022. For nonresidential construction, cost increases were lower but still significant at 12.8 percent. Construction cost increases continued into the second quarter of 2022 amid inflationary pressures throughout the economy. Rising labor shortages are exacerbating the challenges. According to Statistics Canada, construction job vacancies reached a record high in the first quarter of 2022 and were double the number of open positions during the same period in 2020. And then there is the impact of construction wages, which were up 6.6 percent in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2021. All of this has made completing projects on time and on budget even harder than in the past, and the situation is unlikely to improve in the foreseeable future.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!88:  As supply begins to come online, rent growth is expected to deceleratefirst, in untested sub- markets with elevated pipelines. Higher-barrier locations, on the other hand, may sustain higher rent growth for longer. Construction Is Battling Supply Chain Issues Real estate developers across the United States are confronting rising construction costs. Steel, concrete, and roofing materials contribute up to 80 percent of typical shell costs. Market price surges since the end of 2019 for these, and other major catego- ries, caused finished construction costs to spike by 50 percent. Construction durations in the broader industry have increased by two to three months, on average, since 2019, due to lon- ger material lead times and increasing contractor backlogs, according to a construction director at a large industrial owner. Advanced material procurement strategies and construction technology can resolve some ongoing construction issues. Developers are moving upstream in the value chain by lever- aging direct partnerships with national material suppliers to pre-secure and prioritize long-lead building materials and mitigate material shortages where possible. Developers are also introducing modularized construction systems to expedite repeatable project elements, such as office tenant improve- ments and in-warehouse restrooms, which reduce on-site construction timelines.

In the favourable case, clean-up costs will be lower in the next decade than they are today due to economies of scale and technological progress. Given the generally high importance of the housing market and the great earning potential for successful renovators, decisive progress should be possible here. Last but not least, this strategy could also make sense from a climate policy point of view, as the optimal renovation time, 17 April 21, 2023 Germany Monitor 2023 Housing market outlook Temperature difference during summer BerlinBrandenburg vs. Schleswig-Holstein Celsius defined as the minimum sum of all CO2 emissions of a building, could be beyond this decade, at least assuming significant economies of scale and efficiency gains. 39 5.6 Climatic changes and impacts on the housing market To date, climatic location factors have played a small role for investors. This could change as the climate crisis worsens, with both direct and indirect effects on housing demand. In regions with a higher likelihood of extreme weather events, housing demand is reduced due to a lower quality of life. For example, there could be a direct negative impact from rationing water to water the garden or fill up the swimming pool in the more arid regions. Fires are also more likely and tend to increase there. Heavily damaged forests or fields are also likely to dampen demand for housing, especially if such events become more frequent and nature fails to fully regenerate. Demand is also likely to fall in regions that are increasingly affected by floods and inundations. The indirect effects on demand for housing could be even more significant. For example, entire value chains could be broken and business models rendered unprofitable if infrastructure is damaged by heat, dried-up rivers or fires. As prices and rents rise in line with incomes in the long term, rents in the affected regions could rise or fall less sharply. Regions that will be less affected by extreme weather events in the future, on the other hand, could experience higher demand, prices, and rents. Much information is lacking to estimate which regions are more likely to be winners and losers.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!27: 1 Changes to building codes over the past 10 years Sources: National Association of Home Builders.

As one housing industry adviser notes, Theres a stress index about global supply chains, and those stress indices are all indicating that theyre moderating, but theyre still at very high levels. Finally, high permitting fees and utility charges and large minimum lot sizes push developers to build more expensive homes. Renters Priced Out of the Homebuying Market With a growing share of households priced out of the for-sale market, demand for rental units is far outstripping new supply. Though population growth slowed sharply during the pandemic, demand is also rising from the many young adults eager to start their own households after moving back in with their parents during COVID. Further boosting demand is the increasing number of younger adults choosing to live alone, according The multifamily sector has responded with an unprecedented increase in new supply.

Vacancies have fallen to their lowest levels ever while rents are rising faster than evereven faster than home prices. And though not a formal part of the affordability calculations, other housing-related costs like utilities and main- tenance are also rising faster than incomes, further constraining the ability of households to afford basic shelter.

Three, constrained construction of new supply, and a price run-up on the single-family for-sale front, spilled over into expanded apartment demand.  Lastly, compounding the effects of these four dramatic imbalances came the rocket fuel of a global capital rotation toward de-risked assets . Outsized demand, a sudden spike in remote work mobility, constricted supply, and floods of money with nowhere better to goa grand slam of anomalies. The U. S. apartment property sectorproviding shelter to 37 mil- lion residents in 21.3 million structures of five or more household units, and contributing $3.4 trillion annually to the U. S. economy, according to the NMHCmorphed quickly into an investment asset class pressure cooker. Inflated property valuations, com- pressed cap rates, and a sea change from individual owners to medium and large-sized corporate owners became a new norm seemingly overnight. This time period veers wildly from a steady slope of otherwise well-entrenched trends across the structural demand front. Operational modernization kicked into super-fast-forward mode toward self-service, and a robust new-development pipeline at least. According to a recent Bloomberg report, After dipping in 2020, the number of new units authorized in multifamily build- ings took off, running 37 percent higher over the past 12 months as of June 2022 than in the same period in 20182019. As of August, 862,000 apartments were under construction, up 25 percent from a year ago. At the same time, COVIDs aftermath sharply defined conflicting forceswhich together destine virtually all of Americas newly developed and built apartment communities for a financially privileged professional class. Rather than causing an expansion of rental housing stock, however, higher-income households come-lately demand for rental neighborhoods instead served to crowd out moderate- and lower-income households in supply- constrained areas.

And one out of every four households spends 50 percent or more of their wages on housing. Those percentages reflect divides that deepen because not enough new apartment units are coming online. A present that is polarized grows more so over time. For market- rate property investors, developers, owners, and managers, what lies ahead is the brightest beacon of prosperity. But for those who live and reside below the cutline of wherewithal and social mobility, the future of apartment rentals holds more ques- tions than answers. With 1.3 million new U. S. households projected each year through 2035, apartment industry trade groupsthe National Multifamily Housing Council (NMHC) and the National Apartment Associationcalculate that the United States needs 4.3 million newly built apartments between now and then. That level of new development would work out to 331,000 new multifamily rental units annually. This would expand the exist- ing apartment rental stock in the United States by more than 20 percent in just over a decade. What makes this goal plausible are two strong tailwinds: household demographics and an unprecedented global embrace of apartment development by the investment community. Still, the throes of land use policy drag on development. But beyond local policy barriers, tugging housing to its future, are a trio of macro forcesworklife balance, an urgency to stall the climate effects of global warming, and an array of technolo- giesin business management, livability, and construction. Can this darling of real estate asset classes sustain its hold on global investment inflows, unleash constructions modern manu- facturing era, turn the tide on local political will, and win over the hearts, minds, and pocketbooks of consumer households to pull off such a feat?

Too Much for Too Many  Housing affordability has fallen to its lowest level in over 30 years. Prices and rents have soared relative to incomes. Spiraling mortgage rates have pushed the homeownership bar further out of reach for a growing share of households.  The chronic undersupply of housing is the result of govern- ment policies that limit new supply or increase construction costs and is exacerbated by a labor shortage, as well as NIMBYism.  Simply constructing more housing may be the most obvious and effective solution, but is far from easy to achieve. Housing is too expensive. It has been that way for too longfor too many people neither for-sale nor rental housing is afford- ablebut prices and rents have soared even further out of reach over the course of the past year. And even if we experi- ence an economic downturn, as many economists expect, it is not projected to provide significant relief. It starts with record home prices. The U. S. median existing- home price jumped by over 18 percent in 2021 alonethe largest increase on record going back to the early 1950s and then tacked on a further 15 percent through mid-2022. Combined with rapidly rising mortgage rates, housing afford- ability has fallen to its lowest level in over 30 years relative to incomes, according to the National Association of Realtors.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!27: 1 Changes to building codes over the past 10 years Sources: National Association of Home Builders. National Multifamily Housing Council. confidence suggests that that decline will likely continue until the interest rate environment turns more favorable. to a report from economists at the Fed, perhaps a reaction to lockdown claustrophobia. And the homes that do get built are expensive, particularly since the pandemic. Construction costs shot up due to supply chain disruptions and are still worrisome. As one housing industry adviser notes, Theres a stress index about global supply chains, and those stress indices are all indicating that theyre moderating, but theyre still at very high levels. Finally, high permitting fees and utility charges and large minimum lot sizes push developers to build more expensive homes. Renters Priced Out of the Homebuying Market With a growing share of households priced out of the for-sale market, demand for rental units is far outstripping new supply. Though population growth slowed sharply during the pandemic, demand is also rising from the many young adults eager to start their own households after moving back in with their parents during COVID. Further boosting demand is the increasing number of younger adults choosing to live alone, according The multifamily sector has responded with an unprecedented increase in new supply. Weve built more multifamily housing units over the last 10 years than we had in any other time since 1980, notes an adviser to institutional investors. But it is still far less than needed. Vacancies have fallen to their lowest levels ever while rents are rising faster than evereven faster than home prices. And though not a formal part of the affordability calculations, other housing-related costs like utilities and main- tenance are also rising faster than incomes, further constraining the ability of households to afford basic shelter. Moving to More Affordable Recent slowdowns in rent growth and home price appreciation, noted in our Normalizing trend, have done little to increase affordability. So how to address this? Millions of people have taken matters into their own hands.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Deloitte 2023 Commercial Real Estate Outlook.pdf-!10: 23 However, some fundamental forces can help explain why pricing appreciation may endure, albeit slower than the recent torrid pace: better homeowner financial stability and lasting supply constraints. Compared to the rampant development of subprime markets prior to 2008, tighter credit standards today have built a stable foundation for longer-term fixed-rate mortgages. Global markets such as Germany and the United Kingdom have also increasingly adopted this mortgage structure.24 And prices continue to be propped up as the housing market remains woefully undersupplied, exacerbated by pandemic-related construction delays, shortages of materials and labor, and supply chain bottlenecks.25 In the United States, housing specialists dont foresee average global home prices falling over the coming year, but pockets in the most overvalued regions could experience corrections, especially if local governments intervene.26 Deleveraging initiatives by the government in China Mainland, for instance, have slowed investment and prices have slumped.27 Deloittes baseline economic forecast still expects house prices to rise faster than inflation,28 at least in the United States. Since affordability remains a concern, many prospective US consumers will likely seek longer rental leases. Retail HOW DID WE GET HERE? In early 2022, operational challenges due to supply chain issues and waning consumer sentiment softened the previously upbeat outlook for the global retail sector. Supply chain disruptions are impacting transportation and manufacturing costs and inflation is putting a squeeze on consumers disposable income. According to Deloittes Global State of the Consumer Tracker, 77 of the consumers surveyed are concerned about inflation, 11 a notable increase from 68 at the end of last year. And only 45 of consumers expect to spend more on goods than services, down from 48 in December 2021.29 Nevertheless, retail leasing returned in many mature global retail markets. Openings outpaced closings by nearly 100 million square feet last year.30 Retailers pursuing domestic consumer growth have forged ahead with new stores and concepts.31 Brands such as Nike have launched innovative, tech-driven concepts in AP to enhance the retail experience.32 WHATS NEXT? Tourism and travel are expected to be important for retail destinations across the globe, as they are still well below prepandemic levels.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!176:  But higher interest rates will counteract the affordability impacts of any easing of home prices, at least for the time being. And overall affordability pressures are affecting other classes of residential real estate as rising interest rates and the resulting challenges faced by homebuyers in qualifying for financing under the mortgage stress test push many potential purchasers to try to rent a home instead. But with supply also constrained and getting even tighter in the rental market, rising rents are adding to the growing affordability crisis. While the RBCs report noted that worsening affordability condi- tions would be particularly marked in relatively high-priced markets like Toronto and Vancouver, the challenges have been spreading across Canada as Canadians increasingly move to other communitieslike suburbs and evolving 18-hour cities as well as small towns and rural areasin search of cheaper places to live. Migration away from Canadas largest cities which still tend to see population increases as a result of high rates of international immigrationhas been a trend for some time, but the growth of remote working during the pandemic has exacerbated the move outwards and helped make affordability pressures more widespread. We can see the impacts in annual population estimates published earlier in 2022 from Statistics Canada. The findings, which cover annual population changes as of July 1, 2021, include the following:  Toronto and Montreal saw the largest net migration losses to other regions of Ontario and Quebec, respectively, since at least 20012002.  Net intraprovincial migration to rural areas increased across Canada.  As further evidence of the growth of secondary cities and suburbs, the fastest-growing census metropolitan areas were Kelowna, British Columbia , Oshawa, Ontario , and Halifax . These growth rates were well above the average of 0.5 percent across all census metropolitan areas. We can also see evidence of these trends in international immigration statistics published by Statistics Canada. While international immigration is critical to the continuing growth of Canadas largest cities, it is also true that the share of permanent residents settling in regions like Toronto has been declining over time. Looking at Halifax, which is among the cities we have been watching in recent years for the impacts of changing migration trends, the opposite has happened. Its share of immigrants to Canadas census metropolitan areas rose to 1.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, high prices and high interest mortgages are contributing to difficulties for people wanting to become homeowners.

Youve just got to go find it. Our report this year highlights two sometimes-contradictory property market trends: aspects of the industry are normaliz- ing or reverting closer to their pre-COVID patterns, while others appear to have sustained permanent shifts to a new normal as the pandemic induced changes in how and where we use differ- ent types of properties. These same patterns are playing out in how real estate professionals view prospects in the 80 markets tracked for this report. Reflecting the normalizing trend, almost every market in the country received lower ratings for both investment and develop- ment prospects this year, illustrating that outlooks are darkening just about everywhere following the brief post-COVID exuber- ance shown in last years survey across a variety of metrics. Similarly, some of the fastest-growing Sun Belt and other high- flying markets in recent years have faded a bit in the Emerging Trends standings, while many lower-rated markets are improving their relative status. On the other hand, the pandemic seems to have reinforced some trends, notably the dominance of what we called the Magnet marketsmany of which are in warmer Sun Belt regionsat the top of the Emerging Trends Markets to Watch standings, at the expense of the older and colder Exhibit 3-1 Warm versus Cold Climate Markets in Emerging Trends 20 Highest-Rated Markets, 20112023 Sun Belt markets Trendline Midwest and Northeast markets Trendline 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Source: Emerging Trends in Real Estate surveys.

Dissatisfaction with offices did not start in 2020. Worker satisfaction was at an all- time low in 2019 because of factors such as densification, small workspaces, and mismanaged seating. Job one is to correct what was broken in the workplace, said the office consultant. We need to get the topic out of cocktail banter and into science of how to create the best outcomes. The key for office owners is to focus on facilitating the productiv- ity of tenants workforces by improving the health, safety, and functionality of buildings. I think we who are now in the real estate industry must realize we are no longer selling a product but selling a service, said one analyst. Those are different beasts. Any real estate investor that is not taking seriously the possibility that the market is being fundamentally upended is going to get a real shock. Office owners must understand the customer like never before. If not, they will have a problem. Retail It might be easy to assume that the consensus outlook for the retail sector in 2023 would be glum, given the outsized chal- lenges that retail has faced in recent years and with economic uncertainty on the horizon. But instead, there is a general sense of wary optimism, though not without considerable concern about the direction of the overall economy. A Shift from Structural to Cyclical Challenges Not surprisingly, when market participants were asked about the greatest challenges facing retail ahead, economic conditions garnered the most responses. Oversupply and e-commerce followed, but we should note that those issues consistently led survey responses in recent years. Obviously, we are all hyper- focused on the economy right now, one top real estate analyst told us. But for years, the biggest challenges to retail real estate have been deep structural ones related to e-commerce. The question now is whether the pandemic accelerated a lot of those changes, with much pain, and if we are past the worst of the disruptions. This shift in mind-set may be difficult to understand for those accustomed to the popular pre-pandemic narrative of retail apocalypse.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!67:  However, a gigantic hurdle stands in the way of telling fleet- ing trends apart from ones that will last: the pandemic and its aftermath.

Furthermore, with revenue expectations muted, a greater proportion of respondents (33) are planning to cut costs compared to last year, when just 6 planned to make cuts. A RECENT DELOITTE ECONOMICS report offered several scenarios for the near-term outlook in the United States.2 The most likely scenario is that economic growth continues through 2022, though tightening monetary policy, peaking employment growth, and continued energy and food shortages slow this near-term growth trajectory. Inflation would remain high through 2022, but gradually settle around 2 by mid-2023 as demand for goods subsides in favor of services, helping businesses alleviate supply chain issues. The Federal Reserve would raise rates to combat inflation through 2022, but slow rate increases as inflation normalizes. Other, less likely scenarios include: (1) Back to the 1970s (25) where businesses raise prices and wages in lockstep and there is sustained high inflation. (2) COVID-19 relapse (5) in which vaccines become ineffective, and lockdowns are again imposed. And (3) Next recession (15), triggered by overly aggressive tightening of monetary policy as governments attempt to tame inflation. Regardless of which scenario comes to fruition, the 2023 Deloitte real estate outlook survey reveals that concerns about the economy are top of mind for most global real estate leaders as they prepare for the remainder of 2022 and 2023 . Revenue expectations for the full year are mixed among those surveyed, and generally more muted than last year.

Cologne is also bottom of the league along with Stuttgart for prime rents with a figure of EUR 26 per m2 respectively. In the case of Cologne, this is likely also to relate to the fact that the public sector accounts for a large part of the demand for office space. However, after a long period of stagnation, prime rents in Cologne put in a stronger rise from 2018 onwards. As in the other office markets, this reflected a very meagre supply. In spite of growing white-collar employment, the volume of new space remained moderate. The Covid-led decline in letting activity was mostly concentrated in 2020. There was already a strong rise in take-up last year to a high level of slightly over 300,000 m2. This year's take-up could even exceed this figure since take-up in the first half had reached the previous high at around 210,000 m2. Of this, the public sector accounted for almost half  BiMA and the Cologne City Council have leased over 80,000 m2 in two transactions. Cologne is currently the only city among the top locations with a vacancy rate of under 3 per cent, i. e. only marginally above the pre-Covid level. The limited availability of space is likely to mitigate the dampening effect of weak eco- nomic conditions.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!33:  A catchment area of 2.4 million potential customers and a large volume of day-trippers from the Benelux countries are an at- tractive prospect for retailers. However, tourism was not quite as important before Covid as in other top locations. Spending power is also moderate for a top location at 104 points. Unlike Dsseldorf with its distinctive luxury segment, Cologne city centre is focused on lower-end retail. A three kilometre shopping circuit encourages a stroll through prime locations and boosts footfall. One particular example is Schildergasse, the location for many chain store branches. Footfall is also high in Hohe Strae, but below the high levels of Schildergasse. Conversely, Ehrenstrae is a trendy location. A smaller luxury segment has become established in the DomklosterWallrafplatz area. The consequences of the pandemic have clearly had an impact on Cologne ci- ty centre. Between 2019 and the end of 2021 prime rents fell by 12 per cent to EUR 225 per m2, a level which has since been maintained. The rate of decline is on a par with the trend in the top locations, and the relatively large supply of sales space in Cologne city centre has not therefore had any further negative impact on the rent trend. No new information is available on plans announced in spring 2022 to demo- lish the building where the Galeria branch is located in Breiten Strae.

High demand for office space in the first half of 2022 led to take-up of 390,000 m2. The only time this figure was beaten was in the first half of 2017 and 2020 respectively. From the second half of 2022, however, the combination of energy crisis and recession fears is likely to dampen the strength of the Berlin office market and lead to a flattening in the rise in rents. However, high demand combined with a persistently tight supply of contemporary office space means the prospect of a further rise in prime rents. A high level of new space could lead to a further rise in vacancies.

Furthermore, with revenue expectations muted, a greater proportion of respondents (33) are planning to cut costs compared to last year, when just 6 planned to make cuts. A RECENT DELOITTE ECONOMICS report offered several scenarios for the near-term outlook in the United States.2 The most likely scenario is that economic growth continues through 2022, though tightening monetary policy, peaking employment growth, and continued energy and food shortages slow this near-term growth trajectory. Inflation would remain high through 2022, but gradually settle around 2 by mid-2023 as demand for goods subsides in favor of services, helping businesses alleviate supply chain issues. The Federal Reserve would raise rates to combat inflation through 2022, but slow rate increases as inflation normalizes. Other, less likely scenarios include: (1) Back to the 1970s (25) where businesses raise prices and wages in lockstep and there is sustained high inflation. (2) COVID-19 relapse (5) in which vaccines become ineffective, and lockdowns are again imposed. And (3) Next recession (15), triggered by overly aggressive tightening of monetary policy as governments attempt to tame inflation. Regardless of which scenario comes to fruition, the 2023 Deloitte real estate outlook survey reveals that concerns about the economy are top of mind for most global real estate leaders as they prepare for the remainder of 2022 and 2023 . Revenue expectations for the full year are mixed among those surveyed, and generally more muted than last year. While 40 of 4 FIGURE 1 When asked to forecast 2022 revenues, respondents were much less optimistic than they were last year 2023 vs.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!33:   Post-pandemic changes in ways of working and living are modest compared to other parts of the world, which suggests that the persistent sector divides observed elsewhere are likely to be less severe in Asia Pacific. A S I A PAC I F I C The outlook for major Asia Pacific economies is relatively benign in the global context. The developed economies of the region are experiencing inflation rates running below those of the West, although these economies are not immune to tightening financial conditions and slowing global economic growth. The odds of a recession in the next twelve months are increasing, but are still below those of other regions, especially Europe. However, if global inflation persists longer than anticipated, central banks would need to hold interest rates higher for longer and it could take either a severe recession or an exogenous shock to bring down inflation. Under this scenario, the relative economic strength of Asia Pacific could diminish. Asia Pacific is remarkable in that the policymakers of its two largest economies, China and Japan, are implementing monetary policies that are distinctively different from those of other major central banks . China has implemented monetary easing to support the economic recovery and offset some of the negative impacts of its COVID- Zero policy. Monetary easing, combined with various supportive home purchase policies, could be the catalyst for the housing market in China to bottom. The pace of the housing market recovery will depend on the governments efforts to ensure the delivery of unfinished properties by defaulted developers and the direction of the COVID-Zero policy. Public health restrictions in China are likely to fluctuate under the influence of case resurgences. While the timing of China fully unwinding the policy is uncertain, the end of COVID-Zero, if and when it takes place, would bring a welcome upside to regional and global demand. Furthermore, signals from the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party that concluded on October 22, 2022 pointed to a stabilizing domestic environment and ISA Outlook 2023 28 ISA Outlook 2023 29 G LO BA L A S I A PAC I F I C E U R O P E N O R T H A M E R I CA the G20 Summit that ended on November 16, 2022 hinted at easing tensions between the US and China.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!34:  Economic growth in China in 2023 should be below historical averages, but strong enough to make it one of the fastest growing large economies. In Japan, yield curve control comes at the cost of a weak yen. If the Bank of Japan (BoJ) remains committed to keeping interest rates near zero, currency intervention, such as yen-buying to prevent further depreciation, could be on the table again. However, currency intervention has rarely been successful absent the cooperation from other central banks. Any changes to the yield control approach are likely to come after BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kurodas term concludes in April 2023. Nonetheless, most of the challenges Japan is facing are externally driven, while domestic-driven fundamentals remain relatively healthy. Australia, South Korea and Singapore are the most directly impacted by rising interest rates in the West. The outlook of these economies is likely to follow AP.1 Diverging monetary policies in Asia Pacific the trends in the West, albeit to varying degrees. The Monetary Authority of Singapore manages monetary policies through the foreign exchange markets, given that for a small and open economy, the exchange rate has a much stronger influence on inflation than the interest rate. That said, the magnitude of interest rate hikes in Singapore has been less than that of the US. Additionally, an increasing number of firms are pivoting to Singapore for their regional headquarters due to its geopolitical stability. All of these are adding to the relative strength of Singapores economy. The weakness of Asia Pacific currencies is mostly a story of US dollar strength. Nevertheless, uncertainties over the macro outlook and the dispersion among regional economies could lead to the continuing divergence of real estate market performance in the next 12-24 months. The diverse economic and real estate market trends within the region have the potential to contribute diversification benefits to institutional investors global portfolios. Three-month interest rates A S I A PAC I F I C Diverse, domestically- driven capital markets Commercial real estate transaction activities in Asia Pacific during the first nine months of 2022 came off 2021s record highs , primarily driven by rising interest rates in South Korea, Australia and Hong Kong, as well as COVID-19 lockdowns in China.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!6:  For one thing, gross national incomethe income side of the national accounts ledger that is supposed to square with GDPhas been positive over this same period, suggesting flaws in how we measure economic output.

In response to the now lower demand for sales space, Gerber will be converted to a mixed use quarter by 2023. Further building plans in the city centre relate to the new construction of office and retail space to replace the former sports arena (Knig-Schulstrae) and the new Bundesbank building on the former Kaufhof site (Eberhardstrae). The con- verted Sport-Scheck will open at the beginning of the autumn as a pilot branch with a completely new concept over four floors.

To reduce the number of visible vacant properties, the Hamburg Senate has established a funding programme to enable creative businesses and start-ups to temporarily rent unused retail space. By the end of 2022 Karstadt Sport will accordingly become an Artstadt. In summer and autumn 2022, the former Kaufhof store is also being used for an exhibition by the street artist Banksy. However, the long-term use of the two department stores remains unde- cided. A new building with bars and restaurants, a hotel and offices and trade on the ground floor and first floor is also being constructed in Mnckebergstrae to replace the CA store.

Frankfurt is a strong retail location with its two prime locations Zeil and Goethestrae as well as several large shopping centres. Another plus point is the fairly moderate decline in prime rents given the negative conditions. By the end of 2021 they had fallen by around 8 per cent to EUR 275 per m2 and have since remained unchanged. Plans for the City of Frankfurt to play an active role in the development of the city centre - some of which is not very attractive - are also positive. A total of EUR 30m is to be invested in city centre projects, with the aim of upgrading the quality of stay. How- ever, retail is also playing a role here. For example, the Galeria store at the entrance to the Zeil has been remodelled into the Weltstadthaus and has been visibly upgraded while remaining open.

A S I A PAC I F I C The outlook for major Asia Pacific economies is relatively benign in the global context. The developed economies of the region are experiencing inflation rates running below those of the West, although these economies are not immune to tightening financial conditions and slowing global economic growth. The odds of a recession in the next twelve months are increasing, but are still below those of other regions, especially Europe. However, if global inflation persists longer than anticipated, central banks would need to hold interest rates higher for longer and it could take either a severe recession or an exogenous shock to bring down inflation. Under this scenario, the relative economic strength of Asia Pacific could diminish. Asia Pacific is remarkable in that the policymakers of its two largest economies, China and Japan, are implementing monetary policies that are distinctively different from those of other major central banks . China has implemented monetary easing to support the economic recovery and offset some of the negative impacts of its COVID- Zero policy. Monetary easing, combined with various supportive home purchase policies, could be the catalyst for the housing market in China to bottom. The pace of the housing market recovery will depend on the governments efforts to ensure the delivery of unfinished properties by defaulted developers and the direction of the COVID-Zero policy. Public health restrictions in China are likely to fluctuate under the influence of case resurgences. While the timing of China fully unwinding the policy is uncertain, the end of COVID-Zero, if and when it takes place, would bring a welcome upside to regional and global demand.

Furthermore, with revenue expectations muted, a greater proportion of respondents (33) are planning to cut costs compared to last year, when just 6 planned to make cuts. A RECENT DELOITTE ECONOMICS report offered several scenarios for the near-term outlook in the United States.2 The most likely scenario is that economic growth continues through 2022, though tightening monetary policy, peaking employment growth, and continued energy and food shortages slow this near-term growth trajectory. Inflation would remain high through 2022, but gradually settle around 2 by mid-2023 as demand for goods subsides in favor of services, helping businesses alleviate supply chain issues. The Federal Reserve would raise rates to combat inflation through 2022, but slow rate increases as inflation normalizes. Other, less likely scenarios include: (1) Back to the 1970s (25) where businesses raise prices and wages in lockstep and there is sustained high inflation. (2) COVID-19 relapse (5) in which vaccines become ineffective, and lockdowns are again imposed. And (3) Next recession (15), triggered by overly aggressive tightening of monetary policy as governments attempt to tame inflation. Regardless of which scenario comes to fruition, the 2023 Deloitte real estate outlook survey reveals that concerns about the economy are top of mind for most global real estate leaders as they prepare for the remainder of 2022 and 2023 . Revenue expectations for the full year are mixed among those surveyed, and generally more muted than last year. While 40 of 4 FIGURE 1 When asked to forecast 2022 revenues, respondents were much less optimistic than they were last year 2023 vs.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!34:  Economic growth in China in 2023 should be below historical averages, but strong enough to make it one of the fastest growing large economies. In Japan, yield curve control comes at the cost of a weak yen. If the Bank of Japan (BoJ) remains committed to keeping interest rates near zero, currency intervention, such as yen-buying to prevent further depreciation, could be on the table again. However, currency intervention has rarely been successful absent the cooperation from other central banks. Any changes to the yield control approach are likely to come after BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kurodas term concludes in April 2023. Nonetheless, most of the challenges Japan is facing are externally driven, while domestic-driven fundamentals remain relatively healthy. Australia, South Korea and Singapore are the most directly impacted by rising interest rates in the West. The outlook of these economies is likely to follow AP.1 Diverging monetary policies in Asia Pacific the trends in the West, albeit to varying degrees. The Monetary Authority of Singapore manages monetary policies through the foreign exchange markets, given that for a small and open economy, the exchange rate has a much stronger influence on inflation than the interest rate. That said, the magnitude of interest rate hikes in Singapore has been less than that of the US. Additionally, an increasing number of firms are pivoting to Singapore for their regional headquarters due to its geopolitical stability. All of these are adding to the relative strength of Singapores economy. The weakness of Asia Pacific currencies is mostly a story of US dollar strength. Nevertheless, uncertainties over the macro outlook and the dispersion among regional economies could lead to the continuing divergence of real estate market performance in the next 12-24 months. The diverse economic and real estate market trends within the region have the potential to contribute diversification benefits to institutional investors global portfolios.

The denominator effect can be magnified because CRE values in a portfolio are generally appraisal-based, which tend to be backward-looking. However, the impact on CRE portfolios may not be severe this time. Many institutional investors have been under-allocated in CRE, so they will not need to rebalance by selling real estate assets. Furthermore, a rising share of CRE investors is not gov- erned by fixed asset allocations, including public REITs, private investment firms, and high-net-worth individuals, and especially nontraded REITs, which have grown to be among the leading investors in CRE, with an asset value of almost $300 billion in 2021. In sum, capital availability should decline in the near term, though the denominator effect may not force sales as much as in typical downturns. Uncertainty Hesitancy Perhaps the biggest headwind to getting deals done now is uncertainty over where prices will settle. Reflecting the views of many experts we interviewed, one senior investment banker says, Transactions are being done at cap rates that are anywhere from 25 to 75 basis points wider than they werebut there is not any conviction that these are the right levels. That translates into a 5 to 15 percent drop in values so far, with more to come. But there are too few assets trading now to know for sure. Buyers are concerned about overpaying. Says one banker: Now is not the time to be a heromeaning, its not the time to go out and be aggressive on buying something. Its not the time to be aggressive on borrowing. On the other hand, sellers dont want to sell their assets short and then see them retraded at higher prices once the markets improve and few suffer from the financial distress that forces them to. It all translates into fewer deals. One senior adviser to institutional investors said, Its pen- cils down in investment committee. We cant get an acquisition or disposition approved in investment committee at this time. The fundamental issue for many investors is how long the Fed will keep raising rates.;\n\nreal_estate_index:outlook-real-estatet-market-germany-dec-2022.pdf-!12:  In principle, many investment managers and other capital collection agencies still have plenty of money to invest, and capital sources such as insurance companies and pension institutions are continuously receiving more money to invest. However, the trend in recent years of more and more of this money flowing into the real estate markets may have been broken with the turnaround in interest rates. The artificially low interest rates have made the money and bond market unattractive for many years. In addition, central banks have squeezed private investors out of the market with their securities purchase programmes and forced them to invest their money elsewhere, including in real estate. If this period now comes to an end, it could result in a countervailing reallocation process. In combination with monetary tightening, there would then be less money available for real estate investments than before until the long-term growth trend gains the upper hand again. From a German perspective, there is another question: how safe is Germany still perceived as an investment haven? For the moment, we believe we can observe that overseas investors at least have become more cautious. The economic weakness plays a role here, as does the war in Ukraine. On the other hand, the euro has depreciated and the interest rate differential of the euro area against most other currencies has increased significantly. Both make the euro area and thus also Germany more attractive for investors from non-euro countries.

Investors should receive similar ex ante returns for similar risks, or else any free lunches will be arbitraged away. In practice, private market real estate pricing tends to be impacted by broader capital market shifts mainly when there are changes in the cost of real estate debt, since the marginal buyer of income-producing real estate is most often a leveraged buyer. When debt costs rise, the market thins before price pressures are reflected in transactions. This tends to create a time lag between higher interest rates and declines in private equity real estate pricing. In most markets globally, we are now feeling the impact of more expensive real estate debt, which in many cases is no longer accretive to returns at current private market valuations. The math of debt costs and going-in yields is relentless. When the yield starting point is especially low in absolute terms, modest increases in debt costs and yields as measured in basis points mathematically translate into big percentage changes in capital values. As such, evidence of the most significant repricing to date has been concentrated in the lowest- yielding sectors, where transactions have held up most. This has surprised some observers since these low-yielding property types are mostly the winning sectors of recent years and they continue to possess attractive growth profiles. That some of the largest recent value declines may be occurring in the most sought- after property types, such as logistics and residential, might come as a shock after years of banner outperformance, especially during the pandemic. Even so, these property types remain the strongest performers over longer trailing periods and values have also fallen in the less favored sectors, although such adjustments are masked by lower price transparency in these property types. This repricing has been labeled mechanical by some because it is a function of exogenous debt assumptions increasing in investors spreadsheets.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!19:  One of our key themes last year was Everyone Wants In, reflecting the deep and wide investor demand for just about every type of real estate, except central business district (CBD) office and regional malls. Sales volumes jumped to over $800 billion in 2021, according to MSCI Real Assetsalmost double the depressed total in the first pandemic year of 2020 and nearly one-third more than the prior $600 billion record reached in 2019. The surge continued into 2022, with sales volumes in the first half of the year up 38 percent over the same period last year, as even the sharp rise in interest rates did little to dampen transaction volumes. But these recent volumes do not tell the whole storyand the story they do tell may be misleading as to where property markets seem to be heading. Discussions with numerous participants from all corners of the industry confirm that many investors have moved to the sidelinesor to other types of assets like equities and bonds. Indeed, the recent surge may well reflect a last gasp to get deals done before the expected increase in interest rates. Fewer Investors Fewer investors and lenders will be providing capital for assets, according to this years Emerging Trends survey: expectations of availability declined for every one of the 13 equity and debt capital sources. Over the past decade, CRE markets benefited from a substantial capital inflow as alternative investment classes have gained wider acceptance and real estate offered compel- ling risk-adjusted returns. Now, some of those inflows look to reverse. Investor interest is still healthy, but not what it was. Instead of seven or 10 competing offers for sale, theres now two or three, which I think thats normal, says the head of an investment firm. Thats normalizing, too. Several forces look to restrict investor demand, starting with the lower expected returns discussed in our Normalizing trend. Rising interest rates are making acquisition and construc- tion debt more expensive, just when operating incomes seem destined to slide as the economy weakens in the forecasted downturn. Indeed, the prospect of lower income and higher costs is breaking deals, as buyers either seek price breaks or pull out altogether.;\n***\n[Submission]: No, we cannot conclude that the denominator effect is expected to force all institutional investors to sell their real estate assets.

Investors should be patient but prepared to act as opportunities materialize. In the meantime, floating rate debt investment at defensive loan-to-value ratios represents an attractive strategy. Debt re- pricing is nearly instantaneous, while equity re-pricing takes time.  The equilibrium state of monetary policy will require more private capital to participate in the construction of productivity-enhancing infrastructure, such as life sciences facilities, logistics and decarbonizing the value chain. Governments can ill afford another lost decade, but neither can they borrow at scale to finance large infrastructure spending.  Focus on a narrower group of cities, rich in human capital, which will do better economically thanks to tech-heavy industries and services, light manufacturing and tourism. This is not confined only to large cities but includes stand-out secondary markets such as Bristol in the UK and a range of innovative university cities.  Prospects for income growth will be strongest for the best-located assets of a given type for example, offices in vibrant mixed-use zones or logistics assets on crossroads of multiple trans-modal routesand for assets with strong green credentials.

French and Spanish cities posted quarter-on-quarter yield increases of between 15 and 25bps. As risk-free rates are up and expected to remain elevated between 2023 and 2025, we believe office capital values could soften further during the outlook period, and we estimate prime yields in Europe will move out by another 50bps. This would amount to a value loss of around 10 to 15 before stabilization and recovery takes place. Office transaction volumes in Europe already fell by over 20 during Q2 2022 compared with the same year-earlier period. Bouwinvest Outlook 2023-2025 9 Europe Logistics Covid-19 had a surprisingly positive effect on European logistics markets with the accelerated adoption of online shopping more than offsetting the economic turmoil. Now that the pandemic appears to be largely under control, the pace of e-commerce growth has eased, but is still positive and the potential for further expansion remains strong as consumers service expectations continue to evolve and drive demand for logistics properties. reluctance among municipalities to issue land for new logistic space. We expect this latter trend to continue in the coming years, with Germany and France currently showing the most resistance to new greenfield developments. As a result, nominal rental growth, although slowing down, is expected to remain positive during the outlook period at a figure just shy of 3.0 per annum. Global supply chain disruption following the pandemic and ongoing geopolitical tensions are also fuelling a supply chain reconfiguration with a greater emphasis on onshoring over just-in-time. This is boosting domestic demand for logistics real estate and helping to ease wider supply chain pressures. European economic support programmes running until 2027 and totalling 1.1 trillion are expected to provide another boost to the sector.

Rental growth and yield spreads vary significantly between prime, sustainable office assets and secondary stock. Office job numbers are growing but increased working from home (WFH) is likely to have a strong effect on structural demand. Well-located, sustainable, prime CBD offices with good connectivity, access to diverse labour pools and agglomeration benefits, will remain attractive. Such grade A assets can play an important role in maintaining a common corporate culture, personal skill development and networking. Nevertheless, we expect minimal real rental growth during the outlook period, even at the leading prime locations. Like residential properties, office rental contracts also generally have an inflation-linked component. However, persistently high inflation has already started to affect the affordability of index-linked rental properties and office tenants that are under pressure may seek to renegotiate their leases. The European office market is characterised by a large variety of rental contracts and if rental increases are staggered, for example, inflation cannot be passed on fully. At the time of writing, there is little market evidence of repricing of privately owned prime offices, but we estimate that average- quality office values may have fallen by roughly 15 by the end of Q4 2022 since their peak at the end of 2021. This amounts to a yield expansion of about 50bps.

The non-listed real estate market generally lags its listed counterpart by six to nine months and the first signs of a decline became visible in valuations for non-listed properties in Q3 2022. We expect more downward revisions to valuations in the next six to eight quarters, driven by rising interest rates. Should economic conditions deteriorate further, vacancy levels will go up and rental growth will slacken, accelerating a flight to quality among investors.

Frankfurt is a strong retail location with its two prime locations Zeil and Goethestrae as well as several large shopping centres. Another plus point is the fairly moderate decline in prime rents given the negative conditions. By the end of 2021 they had fallen by around 8 per cent to EUR 275 per m2 and have since remained unchanged. Plans for the City of Frankfurt to play an active role in the development of the city centre - some of which is not very attractive - are also positive. A total of EUR 30m is to be invested in city centre projects, with the aim of upgrading the quality of stay. How- ever, retail is also playing a role here. For example, the Galeria store at the entrance to the Zeil has been remodelled into the Weltstadthaus and has been visibly upgraded while remaining open. The former sports arena building which is also close to the Hauptwache is being demolished and will be replaced by 2024 by a modern commercial building with offices.

Space rental should therefore become more difficult again towards year- end, and rents could fall again both this year and next year. Retailers looking for space should therefore retain their strong negotiating position. However, some positive factors are also likely to persist beyond the current crisis conditions. E-commerce benefited from the pandemic. However, despite all the en- thusiasm for online shopping, people still enjoy going on a shopping trip  and ma- king purchases  in the city centre. The boost which the pandemic provided for E- commerce could be less sustained than anticipated. This is borne out by the recent experience of online providers such as Amazon and Shopify, with the former plan- ning to sublet logistics space, and job shedding at the latter. Online shopping will undoubtedly continue to grow, but probably at a slightly slower pace. However, city centre retail also has further potential as the volume of pedestrians and tourists picks up again. It is up to retailers, property owners and cities to exploit this potential.

In response to the now lower demand for sales space, Gerber will be converted to a mixed use quarter by 2023. Further building plans in the city centre relate to the new construction of office and retail space to replace the former sports arena (Knig-Schulstrae) and the new Bundesbank building on the former Kaufhof site (Eberhardstrae). The con- verted Sport-Scheck will open at the beginning of the autumn as a pilot branch with a completely new concept over four floors. The Schlossgartenquartier group of buil- dings at the entrance to the Knigstrae will also be revitalised by 2025.

To reduce the number of visible vacant properties, the Hamburg Senate has established a funding programme to enable creative businesses and start-ups to temporarily rent unused retail space. By the end of 2022 Karstadt Sport will accordingly become an Artstadt. In summer and autumn 2022, the former Kaufhof store is also being used for an exhibition by the street artist Banksy. However, the long-term use of the two department stores remains unde- cided. A new building with bars and restaurants, a hotel and offices and trade on the ground floor and first floor is also being constructed in Mnckebergstrae to replace the CA store.

In Japan, yield curve control comes at the cost of a weak yen. If the Bank of Japan (BoJ) remains committed to keeping interest rates near zero, currency intervention, such as yen-buying to prevent further depreciation, could be on the table again. However, currency intervention has rarely been successful absent the cooperation from other central banks. Any changes to the yield control approach are likely to come after BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kurodas term concludes in April 2023. Nonetheless, most of the challenges Japan is facing are externally driven, while domestic-driven fundamentals remain relatively healthy. Australia, South Korea and Singapore are the most directly impacted by rising interest rates in the West. The outlook of these economies is likely to follow AP.1 Diverging monetary policies in Asia Pacific the trends in the West, albeit to varying degrees. The Monetary Authority of Singapore manages monetary policies through the foreign exchange markets, given that for a small and open economy, the exchange rate has a much stronger influence on inflation than the interest rate. That said, the magnitude of interest rate hikes in Singapore has been less than that of the US. Additionally, an increasing number of firms are pivoting to Singapore for their regional headquarters due to its geopolitical stability. All of these are adding to the relative strength of Singapores economy. The weakness of Asia Pacific currencies is mostly a story of US dollar strength. Nevertheless, uncertainties over the macro outlook and the dispersion among regional economies could lead to the continuing divergence of real estate market performance in the next 12-24 months. The diverse economic and real estate market trends within the region have the potential to contribute diversification benefits to institutional investors global portfolios.

Financial conditions in Singapore are expected to fare slightly better than those of South Korea and Australia, as Singapore benefits from strong investor appetite due to its relative economic strength and geopolitical stability. Although uncertainties remain, monetary easing, the rise of RMB funds, the rapid development of domestic REITs in China and the gradual relaxation of COVID restrictions in Hong Kong could offset some downside risks in these two capital markets.

A S I A PAC I F I C The outlook for major Asia Pacific economies is relatively benign in the global context. The developed economies of the region are experiencing inflation rates running below those of the West, although these economies are not immune to tightening financial conditions and slowing global economic growth. The odds of a recession in the next twelve months are increasing, but are still below those of other regions, especially Europe. However, if global inflation persists longer than anticipated, central banks would need to hold interest rates higher for longer and it could take either a severe recession or an exogenous shock to bring down inflation. Under this scenario, the relative economic strength of Asia Pacific could diminish. Asia Pacific is remarkable in that the policymakers of its two largest economies, China and Japan, are implementing monetary policies that are distinctively different from those of other major central banks . China has implemented monetary easing to support the economic recovery and offset some of the negative impacts of its COVID- Zero policy. Monetary easing, combined with various supportive home purchase policies, could be the catalyst for the housing market in China to bottom. The pace of the housing market recovery will depend on the governments efforts to ensure the delivery of unfinished properties by defaulted developers and the direction of the COVID-Zero policy. Public health restrictions in China are likely to fluctuate under the influence of case resurgences. While the timing of China fully unwinding the policy is uncertain, the end of COVID-Zero, if and when it takes place, would bring a welcome upside to regional and global demand.

For investors with a higher risk tolerance, we recommend preserving dry powder and monitoring for pockets of price adjustment. It is time to be a patient opportunistwaiting and watching for attractive discounts if dislocation occurs in this region. LOOKING AHEAD  The math of rising interest rates in many Asia Pacific markets is expected to weigh on returns. In this environment, we recommend going back to basics. Supply-demand dynamics are critical in the context of a slowing economy with rising tenant operating costs. Market, submarket and asset selection are key, even in the favored sectors. Focus on asset management to achieve return targets instead of counting on market growth.  Japan remains an attractive diversifier for institutional investors regional and global real estate portfolios, due to the relative resiliency of its occupier and capital market fundamentals, its stable geopolitical environment and divergent monetary policies.

The regions mix of inflationary forces go beyond the usual supply chain pressures and tight labor markets, to include the more detrimental impact of exogenous shocks.  As of the time of writing, European energy costs were trending down due to warmer weather and full natural gas storage facilities going into the winter months. But Europe remains vulnerable and will have to invest rapidly to reduce its energy vulnerabilities over the coming years.  Property fundamentals remain reasonably benign in most European markets, cushioning some of the blow from a significant upward adjustment in yields that is being hidden from view by a wide bid-ask spread and decline in transaction volumes. Europe is beginning to adapt to a new economic and political reality. It is experiencing a severe negative energy shock on top of the normalization of fiscal and monetary policies that is occurring across other Western nations.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, it is accurate to say that while the Monetary Authority of Singapore manages monetary policies through the foreign exchange markets, Singapore's economic strength and geopolitical stability are likely to fare slightly better financial conditions than South Korea and Australia .\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

All of these positive and negative factors together paint a kind of a Rorschach test, where observers can draw their own conclusions as to the strength of the economy. The End of the Beginning But there is one issue on which our interviewees agree: The exis- tential risk for the real estate economy right now is that Fed action in response to persistent inflation will tip us into a recession, says a senior partner with a leading advisory firm. But can the Federal Reserve Bank tame inflation without breaking the economy? Moderating inflation rates this summer led many to believe that the worst was over and that the Fed could soon ease up its con- tractionary monetary policy. Indeed, the consensus of experts we interviewed this summer was that the Fed would cease tightening by the end of 2022 and start cutting rates again in mid-2023. That sentiment now appears optimistic. Inflation is going to be a little stickier than people think, said an investment banking executive we interviewed during the summer, whose views turned out to be more prescient. Sentiment started changing in late August when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell gave his annual speech to fellow central bankers affirming the Fed view that infla- tion is not nearly under control, jolting markets. Any remaining doubt about that was quashed by the official Fed commentary accompanying their September rate announcement projecting that rates would keep rising through 2023. As Winston Churchill famously cautioned after the British army won a critical WWII battle, the victory marked not the end, not even the beginning of the end, but, possibly, the end of the beginning. 4 Higher for Longer With interest rates headed higher for longer, the risk of a deeper, full-fledged recession is rising, according to a grow- ing consensus of economists. In an August 2022 survey by the National Association of Business Economics, only a quarter of economists were even somewhat confident that the Fed could bring down inflation to its target range without causing a recession. Worrying signs out of Europe in early autumn and expectations of soaring heating bills this coming winter add to the gloomy global economic outlook.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!15: 5 Spiking rates drive rapid tightening of financial conditions Cost of capital rising sharply in most geographies Nominal corporate bond yields 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 7 0 n a J 8 0 n a J 9 0 n a J 0 1 n a J 1 1 n a J 2 1 n a J 3 1 n a J 4 1 n a J 5 1 n a J 6 1 n a J 7 1 n a J 8 1 n a J 9 1 n a J 0 2 n a J 1 2 n a J 2 2 n a J US C.

LOOKING AHEAD  The relentless math of higher interest rates will continue to weigh heavily on real estate values, at least until interest rates stabilize as inflation begins to subside. The bid- ask spread for private real estate should eventually close and transactions will resume in earnest at a rebased level.  In the meantime, investment styles that are less sensitive to volatility in values should be contemplated, such as floating-rate lending with a comfortable cushion from lower loan-to-value ratios. Debt investment can be attractive at times of uncertainty, as investors tilt toward contractually certain income and away from an uncertain upside. Portfolio aggregation strategies with smaller asset sizes that lend themselves to averaging-in with diversified timing of entry points represent another way to cope with volatile and uncertain values.  The inputs to the math are not changing to the same degree in every part of the world. Wherever rate spikes are less intense, or the prospects for rental growth are clearest, transaction activity and prices have been less impacted.  In addition to debt costs, investors should also consider the trajectory of cash flows, which depend on economic fundamentals and real estate occupier market conditions. The differential prospects for real estate cash flows are the subject of the next section.;\n\nreal_estate_index:global-real-estate-markets-2023.pdf-!1:  We also dive into student housing in the US, another sector booming among investors, and what impact demographic trends might have on it. In addition, we analyze how opportunistic and value-add managers will need to adopt their strategies now that interest rates are higher, and how their ability to generate out-size returns simply by adding leverage is gone. So, a number of important topics for us and investors to consider. We hope you find our answers insightful and useful in determining your strategy and thinking about some of the key questions in real estate as we move into the new year. Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy. Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs. We have already started to see cap rates and yields rise in many markets, with the most rapid adjustment taking place in the UK. However, we do not think that prices fully reflect higher interest rates yet. To assess when values might bottom out, we can look to past downturns and the listed market for guidance. In the Global Financial Crisis, for example, global capital values bottomed out in 4Q09, while GDP across global real estate markets troughed three quarters earlier, in 1Q09, as did global listed real estate prices1. Market downturns usually present opportunities, and one we expect for investors in 2023 is a correction in pricing as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. Although we do not expect large amounts of distress in the market, we do expect some, already apparent in parts of the UK market. This should allow investors access to assets at attractive pricing. The early 1990s downturn was longer, with US capital values continuing to decline into 1995. We expect modest declines in GDP in the first half of 2023 before growth resumes.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!5:  1 2 Taking the Long View The short-term risks are real, and Im not making light of any of them. But if you have the long view, I dont think its time to panic. 100 s t n e d n o p s e r f o e g a t n e c r e P 80 60 40 20 0 Interest rates are rising, economic clouds are darkening, and real estate deal flows are sinking because buyers and sellers cannot agree on pricing. But for all that, most commercial real estate professionals we interviewed for this years Emerging Trends remain reasonably upbeat about longer-term prospects. Not everyone is as sanguine as the CEO of an investment management firm who provided our opening quote, and there certainly are some troubling risks ahead for the industry. But the consensus mood seems to be one of cautious optimism that we will ride out any near-term slump and be well positioned for another period of sustained growth and strong returns. It makes sense that real estate experts would take the long view given the nature of real estate assets: buildings take a long time to conceive and develop. Even simply acquiring one typically takes more time than buying just about any other type of financial asset, and they are usually held for longer dura- tions. Still, the willingness of so many people in the industry to look beyond some of the cyclical headwinds is striking. Says the head of advisory services for a commercial real estate (CRE) analytics firm, The recessionif we go into onewill obviously impact some markets worse than others, but its just like any- thing else. Well look back in 10 years, and the prices that seem astronomical today will seem like a bargain 10 years from now. An Economic Rorschach Test By one popular rule of thumb, the U. S. economy entered a recession in the first half of 2022, having sustained two straight quarters of (modestly) declining gross domestic product (GDP). But if we were in a recession at the time of writing, it would be a most peculiar one.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, the concern about how long the Fed will keep raising rates is justified considering that these rising rates could negatively impact real estate values.

These activities will also support specific real estate investment opportunities, such as incorporating on-site renewables. Real estate fundamentals holding up Capital markets stresses, not the lack of demand from occupiers to relocate, expand or upgrade their space, define the current crisis. Despite the extensive market uncertainty, many European occupier markets continue to show surprisingly robust activity, at least so far. The key to this has been a combination of occupiers playing catch-up post-pandemic, long- standing shortages of certain kinds of stock, tightening limitations on land use and supply discipline driven by developers and their lenders. Office take-up in the first three quarters of 2022 has been 6.7 above the five-year average, according to JLL. European office vacancy rates have remained below the long-term average of 7.5, with many markets posting vacancy rates still comfortably below their natural rates of vacancy , as shown in Exhibit EU.4. Sentiment can turn quickly, however. Office users continue to contend with uncertainty around how much and what sort of space they will require in the long term. As we suggest in the global section of this report, a stable balance of in-person and virtual interaction may have been reached, but long leases and wait-and-see attitudes mean we do not yet have clarity on sustainable levels of office demand.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!32:  LOOKING AHEAD  The European energy crisis shows how quickly energy efficiency can move from being nice to have to an economic imperative. The rest of the world is not in the same situation as Europe, but its experience shows that conditions can change quickly and it is better to prepare for the future than to be simply reactive.  Physical climate risk must be managed at two levels: at the portfolio level, through assessment of exposure concentrations and consideration of how climate risk informs overall portfolio construction strategies. And at the property level, through evaluating both existing and potential new hardening strategies to be more resilient against particular hazards.  Incremental investments in hardening against physical climate change, increasing energy efficiency and installing on-site renewables may, in certain situations and especially for existing portfolio assets in Europe, offer one of the most attractive risk-adjusted returns on capital available today.  The transition to a decarbonized world also brings nonphysical transition risks that tend to be specific to local markets. These include changes in insurance availability and costs, regulations, taxes, incentives, and changes in tenant and capital market demand.  For a deeper dive on the energy transition and how it relates to real estate strategies, have a look at LaSalles November 2022 report Decarbonization and the Evolution to Net Zero Carbon Real estate.

Key uncertainties include whether the Bank of Japan can continue to keep long-yields low and the prospects for China ending its COVID-Zero regime.

There will likely also be lasting ramifications for the project of European integration, with outcomes depending on whether European nation-states decide to share the burden or go it alone. It may also reset relations between governments and their people, whose expectations for state intervention to avert negative economic outcomes have rarely been higher. Sharing challenges like inflation, climate change, currency stability, Russian aggression, refugee relief and energy policy may realign UK and EU policies to a greater degree than at any time since the Brexit vote. In real estate terms, the major markets of Europe are highly varied. Yet, when viewed from a global perspective, they are quite like one another in terms of their focus on green building policies, reliance on public transport, cautious approach to new supply and their proximity to an armed conflict.

The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated huge government fiscal interventions to support consumers and businesses through periods of mandated closure. These came on the heels of a decade in which sovereign debt crises and austerity had already seen productivity growth stagnate without meaningfully improving sovereign balance sheets in peripheral Europe. Reopening as the pandemic entered the endemic phase saw supply chain stresses and uneven demand patterns drive shortfalls in the availability of goods and labor. The energy supply crunch resulting from European support for Ukraine added a huge exogenous cost shock to the existing global and regional price pressure, driving European inflation readings to the highest level in the world by the end of 2022, on top of the future costs of new commitments to defense spending. The war in Ukraine will eventually end, but barring an unexpected change in Russian leadership, the deflationary impact of its cheap natural gas to heat homes and power industry will not return.;\n\nreal_estate_index:bouwinvest_international-market-outlook_2023-2025-1.pdf-!0: Real Estate Outlook 2023-2025 Challenging times ahead Table of contents Table of contents Executive Summary Europe North America Asia Pacific Contact 3 4 12 20 29 Bouwinvest Outlook 2023-2025 2 Executive Summary Global Real Estate at Crossroads During the three-year period through 2025, Europe will be characterised by slower economic growth, higher interest rates and elevated uncertainty. The tightening - or even negative - spread between real estate yields and government bond yields - a proxy for the risk-free rate - will lead to asset repricing across Europe, potentially generating opportunities for non-leveraged investors. Residential and logistics real estate markets continue to be better placed than offices and retail due to fundamental occupier demand drivers, while niche segments generate interesting opportunities. In the U. S. the southern sunbelt states are expected to outshine other parts of the country due to migration patterns, a tax-friendly environment, expanding workforce and greater affordability. Various niche sectors across North America, including data centres, life science and medical office buildings, self-storage, and manufactured housing, are already quite mature and point to the way forward for the future development of real estate markets elsewhere in the world. Within the heterogenous Asia-Pacific region, Australia is cementing its status as a safe haven. Singapore, meanwhile, is expected to see its relative attractiveness increase versus Hong Kong while a zero-Covid-19 policy, a troubled property sector and geopolitical tensions have added a risk premium in China. Japan is one of the few international markets where policy interest rates remain low and therefore the spread between the risk-free rate and real estate yields remains stable. All regions globally are heading in the same direction: towards more energy-efficient, circular and sustainable buildings together with increased reporting and disclosure requirements.

As a look at the early 1990s shows, prime real estate yields can even be below bond yields. Such a constellation presupposes high rental growth expectations. Given the current macro environment, we believe that investor expectations of rental growth are not sufficiently high for this in any sector. The logistics market and the less regulated part of the residential market might be an exception. But here, too, the uncertainty about further developments is likely to be too great, at least temporarily. Another relevant lower edge for property yields is financing costs. At the end of the third quarter of 2022, prime yields in all major market segments were below the cost of debt capital . This situation could only persist if the number of equity buyers is sufficiently large. Indeed, such investors are currently quite active and are taking advantage of the lower prices for purchases. However, we think it unlikely that the existing equity volume will be sufficient to anchor prices below the cost of financing. The fact that the increase in initial yields is nevertheless likely to be comparatively flat is also due to the mostly comfortable financing situation on the part of the landlords. Apart from the project development segment, we expect few forced sales. We rule out a wave of non-performing loans like after the financial crisis. Nevertheless, the steep rise in interest rates is likely to put individual landlords under stress, especially in the value-add and opportunistic segments, where financing durations are typically short. Lower demand for space and rents due to the recession could jeopardise the implementation of the business plan and thus also refinancing.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!20:  10 Exhibit 1-6 Availability of Capital for Real Estate, 2023 versus 2022 2023 2022 Lending source Nonbank nancial institutions Debt funds Government-sponsored enterprises Insurance companies Mortgage REITs Commercial banks Securitized lendersCMBS Equity source Private-equityopportunity hedge funds Foreign investors Private REITs Private local investors Institutional investors pension funds Public-equity REITs 3.05 3.44 2.99 3.26 2.97 3.39 2.83 3.44 2.72 3.42 2.58 3.63 2.56 3.61 3.18 3.74 3.09 3.54 3.00 3.59 2.98 3.66 2.89 3.67 2.73 3.40 2023 2022 1 2 Large decline 3 Stay the same 4 5 Large increase Source: Emerging Trends in Real Estate surveys. Note: Based on U. S. respondents only. Says the regional leader of one global firm, Cap rates have gapped out as interest rates went up. And suddenly, things didnt pencil, and that generated broken deals. The cost of financing for real estate and everything else went up dramatically. And so everything has to be repriced, everything has to be reset. Also limiting investor demand: debt is getting more difficult to obtain, and the Emerging Trends survey expects underwriting standards to get even more rigorous. As the partner in one lead- ing advisory firm explains, This is one of those cash is king situations where borrowing costs are higher, and if youre an all- cash buyer, those probably represent a disproportionate share of the people in the market today. Meanwhile, the same interest rate increases that reduce lever- aged returns and thus demand for real estate also make bonds and other interest-bearing investments more compelling. As the head of real estate banking at one investment bank explains, Rising bond yields are going to mean that real estate and other alternatives are all going to be facing less availability of capital and some outflows.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!59:  1 2 - c e D 2 2 - n a J 2 2 - b e F 2 2 - r a M 2 2 - r p A 2 2 - y a M 2 2 - n u J 2 2 - u J l 2 2 - g u A 2 2 - p e S 2 2 - t c O 2 2 - v o N Date of forecast GDP Forecast for: US 2023 Canada 2023 US 2024 Canada 2024 Source: Oxford Economics, as of November 16, 2022. around long-term interest rates and pricing than around near-term economic growth and real estate fundamentals. We are reluctant to make investment decisions based solely on a view of future interest rates, but acknowledge that real estate pricing is linked to future interest rates. Given this dynamic, we recommend investors consider a range of interest rate scenarios . Interest rate increases and the relentless math Each time interest rates ticked higher since the GFC, the question of when higher debt costs would impact real estate values was asked. It was a speculative question, with the underlying assumption that rate increases thus far had not yet impacted values. Regardless of the answer then, it became very clear in 2022 that the relentless math of higher borrowing rates was having an impact on leveraged returns and asset values . The boost investors were getting from borrowing has shifted to a drag on a cash basis, but with unleveraged internal rates of return generally above borrowing rates, leverage is still marginally accretive on a total return basis. However, with less lift from borrowing, leveraged buyers are largely out of the market . Higher borrowing rates are a function of both higher indices and increased borrowing spreads. Lending volume is down significantly and lenders are becoming more conservative. The supply of debt capital from large money center banks is down due to large positions taken in the first half of 2022 coupled with stress testing. The Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (CMBS) market continues to be impacted by volatility and life companies are looking into 2023 until fresh allocations become available.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!19:  One of our key themes last year was Everyone Wants In, reflecting the deep and wide investor demand for just about every type of real estate, except central business district (CBD) office and regional malls. Sales volumes jumped to over $800 billion in 2021, according to MSCI Real Assetsalmost double the depressed total in the first pandemic year of 2020 and nearly one-third more than the prior $600 billion record reached in 2019. The surge continued into 2022, with sales volumes in the first half of the year up 38 percent over the same period last year, as even the sharp rise in interest rates did little to dampen transaction volumes. But these recent volumes do not tell the whole storyand the story they do tell may be misleading as to where property markets seem to be heading. Discussions with numerous participants from all corners of the industry confirm that many investors have moved to the sidelinesor to other types of assets like equities and bonds. Indeed, the recent surge may well reflect a last gasp to get deals done before the expected increase in interest rates. Fewer Investors Fewer investors and lenders will be providing capital for assets, according to this years Emerging Trends survey: expectations of availability declined for every one of the 13 equity and debt capital sources. Over the past decade, CRE markets benefited from a substantial capital inflow as alternative investment classes have gained wider acceptance and real estate offered compel- ling risk-adjusted returns. Now, some of those inflows look to reverse. Investor interest is still healthy, but not what it was. Instead of seven or 10 competing offers for sale, theres now two or three, which I think thats normal, says the head of an investment firm. Thats normalizing, too. Several forces look to restrict investor demand, starting with the lower expected returns discussed in our Normalizing trend. Rising interest rates are making acquisition and construc- tion debt more expensive, just when operating incomes seem destined to slide as the economy weakens in the forecasted downturn. Indeed, the prospect of lower income and higher costs is breaking deals, as buyers either seek price breaks or pull out altogether.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, we can infer that all-cash buyers gained more prominence in the market during the end of 2022 due to the higher borrowing costs and prime yields being below the cost of debt capital .\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

Furthermore, with revenue expectations muted, a greater proportion of respondents (33) are planning to cut costs compared to last year, when just 6 planned to make cuts. A RECENT DELOITTE ECONOMICS report offered several scenarios for the near-term outlook in the United States.2 The most likely scenario is that economic growth continues through 2022, though tightening monetary policy, peaking employment growth, and continued energy and food shortages slow this near-term growth trajectory. Inflation would remain high through 2022, but gradually settle around 2 by mid-2023 as demand for goods subsides in favor of services, helping businesses alleviate supply chain issues. The Federal Reserve would raise rates to combat inflation through 2022, but slow rate increases as inflation normalizes. Other, less likely scenarios include: (1) Back to the 1970s (25) where businesses raise prices and wages in lockstep and there is sustained high inflation. (2) COVID-19 relapse (5) in which vaccines become ineffective, and lockdowns are again imposed. And (3) Next recession (15), triggered by overly aggressive tightening of monetary policy as governments attempt to tame inflation. Regardless of which scenario comes to fruition, the 2023 Deloitte real estate outlook survey reveals that concerns about the economy are top of mind for most global real estate leaders as they prepare for the remainder of 2022 and 2023 . Revenue expectations for the full year are mixed among those surveyed, and generally more muted than last year.

Deloitte Insights deloitte. cominsights METHODOLOGY The Deloitte Center for Financial Services conducted a global survey among 450 chief financial officers (CFOs) of major commercial real estate owners and investment companies. Survey respondents were asked to share their opinions on their organizations growth prospects and forward plans for workforce, operations, technology, and culture. We also asked about their investment priorities and anticipated structural changes in 2023. Respondents were equally distributed among three regionsNorth America , Europe , and AsiaPacific . The survey included real estate companies with assets under management of at least US$100 million and was completed in June 2022. Overall, respondents indicated that sustained high inflation, workforce management, cyber risk and climate-related regulatory action are most likely to impact revenue prospects for the next 1218 months . While North American respondents felt that changes in tax policies were of greatest concern (37), European respondents are most concerned about the impacts of climate change (33) and those in AsiaPacific (AP) cite supply chain disruption as their No. 1 concern (40).;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!59:  1 2 - c e D 2 2 - n a J 2 2 - b e F 2 2 - r a M 2 2 - r p A 2 2 - y a M 2 2 - n u J 2 2 - u J l 2 2 - g u A 2 2 - p e S 2 2 - t c O 2 2 - v o N Date of forecast GDP Forecast for: US 2023 Canada 2023 US 2024 Canada 2024 Source: Oxford Economics, as of November 16, 2022. around long-term interest rates and pricing than around near-term economic growth and real estate fundamentals. We are reluctant to make investment decisions based solely on a view of future interest rates, but acknowledge that real estate pricing is linked to future interest rates. Given this dynamic, we recommend investors consider a range of interest rate scenarios . Interest rate increases and the relentless math Each time interest rates ticked higher since the GFC, the question of when higher debt costs would impact real estate values was asked. It was a speculative question, with the underlying assumption that rate increases thus far had not yet impacted values. Regardless of the answer then, it became very clear in 2022 that the relentless math of higher borrowing rates was having an impact on leveraged returns and asset values . The boost investors were getting from borrowing has shifted to a drag on a cash basis, but with unleveraged internal rates of return generally above borrowing rates, leverage is still marginally accretive on a total return basis. However, with less lift from borrowing, leveraged buyers are largely out of the market . Higher borrowing rates are a function of both higher indices and increased borrowing spreads. Lending volume is down significantly and lenders are becoming more conservative. The supply of debt capital from large money center banks is down due to large positions taken in the first half of 2022 coupled with stress testing. The Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (CMBS) market continues to be impacted by volatility and life companies are looking into 2023 until fresh allocations become available.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!61: 0 Forecast US forward curve Canada US US Canada 2 0 1 3 2 0 4 1 2 0 5 1 2 0 6 1 2 0 1 7 2 0 8 1 2 0 9 1 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 1 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 3 2 0 2 4 2 0 2 5 2 0 2 6 2 0 1 3 2 0 4 1 2 0 5 1 2 0 6 1 2 0 1 7 2 0 8 1 2 0 9 1 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 1 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 3 2 0 2 4 2 0 2 5 2 0 2 6 Source: Bloomberg, Oxford Economics, Economy. com, LaSalle Investment Management.

When new pricing is established, it will provide market evidence to help brokers supply accurate opinions of value and enable sellers to have realistic pricing expectations. But until that occurs, properties will be offered on the hope that aspirational pricing targets anchored on peak levels will be achieved and a bid-ask gap will persist. Our expectation is that transaction activity will be below average in 2023, but start to recover in some sectors later in the year. While unleveraged buyers are not directly impacted by higher interest rates, they are also shifting their pricing and buying activity. They are adjusting their cost of capital in response to the broader capital markets, and unleveraged or low-leverage buyers are capital constrained as well.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, the projected value depreciation during the forecast period is expected to be impacted by higher borrowing rates, according to  and .\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

In Japan, yield curve control comes at the cost of a weak yen. If the Bank of Japan (BoJ) remains committed to keeping interest rates near zero, currency intervention, such as yen-buying to prevent further depreciation, could be on the table again. However, currency intervention has rarely been successful absent the cooperation from other central banks. Any changes to the yield control approach are likely to come after BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kurodas term concludes in April 2023. Nonetheless, most of the challenges Japan is facing are externally driven, while domestic-driven fundamentals remain relatively healthy. Australia, South Korea and Singapore are the most directly impacted by rising interest rates in the West. The outlook of these economies is likely to follow AP.1 Diverging monetary policies in Asia Pacific the trends in the West, albeit to varying degrees. The Monetary Authority of Singapore manages monetary policies through the foreign exchange markets, given that for a small and open economy, the exchange rate has a much stronger influence on inflation than the interest rate. That said, the magnitude of interest rate hikes in Singapore has been less than that of the US. Additionally, an increasing number of firms are pivoting to Singapore for their regional headquarters due to its geopolitical stability. All of these are adding to the relative strength of Singapores economy. The weakness of Asia Pacific currencies is mostly a story of US dollar strength. Nevertheless, uncertainties over the macro outlook and the dispersion among regional economies could lead to the continuing divergence of real estate market performance in the next 12-24 months. The diverse economic and real estate market trends within the region have the potential to contribute diversification benefits to institutional investors global portfolios.

Financial conditions in Singapore are expected to fare slightly better than those of South Korea and Australia, as Singapore benefits from strong investor appetite due to its relative economic strength and geopolitical stability.

A S I A PAC I F I C The outlook for major Asia Pacific economies is relatively benign in the global context. The developed economies of the region are experiencing inflation rates running below those of the West, although these economies are not immune to tightening financial conditions and slowing global economic growth. The odds of a recession in the next twelve months are increasing, but are still below those of other regions, especially Europe. However, if global inflation persists longer than anticipated, central banks would need to hold interest rates higher for longer and it could take either a severe recession or an exogenous shock to bring down inflation. Under this scenario, the relative economic strength of Asia Pacific could diminish. Asia Pacific is remarkable in that the policymakers of its two largest economies, China and Japan, are implementing monetary policies that are distinctively different from those of other major central banks . China has implemented monetary easing to support the economic recovery and offset some of the negative impacts of its COVID- Zero policy. Monetary easing, combined with various supportive home purchase policies, could be the catalyst for the housing market in China to bottom. The pace of the housing market recovery will depend on the governments efforts to ensure the delivery of unfinished properties by defaulted developers and the direction of the COVID-Zero policy. Public health restrictions in China are likely to fluctuate under the influence of case resurgences. While the timing of China fully unwinding the policy is uncertain, the end of COVID-Zero, if and when it takes place, would bring a welcome upside to regional and global demand.

For investors with a higher risk tolerance, we recommend preserving dry powder and monitoring for pockets of price adjustment. It is time to be a patient opportunistwaiting and watching for attractive discounts if dislocation occurs in this region. LOOKING AHEAD  The math of rising interest rates in many Asia Pacific markets is expected to weigh on returns. In this environment, we recommend going back to basics. Supply-demand dynamics are critical in the context of a slowing economy with rising tenant operating costs. Market, submarket and asset selection are key, even in the favored sectors. Focus on asset management to achieve return targets instead of counting on market growth.  Japan remains an attractive diversifier for institutional investors regional and global real estate portfolios, due to the relative resiliency of its occupier and capital market fundamentals, its stable geopolitical environment and divergent monetary policies.

As of the time of writing, European energy costs were trending down due to warmer weather and full natural gas storage facilities going into the winter months. But Europe remains vulnerable and will have to invest rapidly to reduce its energy vulnerabilities over the coming years.  Property fundamentals remain reasonably benign in most European markets, cushioning some of the blow from a significant upward adjustment in yields that is being hidden from view by a wide bid-ask spread and decline in transaction volumes. Europe is beginning to adapt to a new economic and political reality. It is experiencing a severe negative energy shock on top of the normalization of fiscal and monetary policies that is occurring across other Western nations.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, it is fair to claim that despite the Monetary Authority of Singapore directing monetary policies through foreign exchange markets, Singapore's economic resilience and geopolitical equilibrium are predicted to withstand slightly superior financial conditions compared to South Korea and Australia.

And one out of every four households spends 50 percent or more of their wages on housing. Those percentages reflect divides that deepen because not enough new apartment units are coming online. A present that is polarized grows more so over time. For market- rate property investors, developers, owners, and managers, what lies ahead is the brightest beacon of prosperity. But for those who live and reside below the cutline of wherewithal and social mobility, the future of apartment rentals holds more ques- tions than answers. With 1.3 million new U. S. households projected each year through 2035, apartment industry trade groupsthe National Multifamily Housing Council (NMHC) and the National Apartment Associationcalculate that the United States needs 4.3 million newly built apartments between now and then. That level of new development would work out to 331,000 new multifamily rental units annually. This would expand the exist- ing apartment rental stock in the United States by more than 20 percent in just over a decade. What makes this goal plausible are two strong tailwinds: household demographics and an unprecedented global embrace of apartment development by the investment community. Still, the throes of land use policy drag on development. But beyond local policy barriers, tugging housing to its future, are a trio of macro forcesworklife balance, an urgency to stall the climate effects of global warming, and an array of technolo- giesin business management, livability, and construction. Can this darling of real estate asset classes sustain its hold on global investment inflows, unleash constructions modern manu- facturing era, turn the tide on local political will, and win over the hearts, minds, and pocketbooks of consumer households to pull off such a feat?

The Pandemic: This Time Is Different With the pandemic and the cascade of economic and social policies it set off, five macro apartment industry tailwinds reached gale-force levels:  One, there was a preexisting multigenerational avalanche of both rent-by-choice and rent-by-necessity demand for multifamily rental units.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!69:  You cant build ground-up affordable because of the price of land, and the regulations that govern that, and everything the NIMBY activists rule . . it all puts a real damper on the industrys ability to produce. In mid-2022, yet another freshly drawn inflection pointcoin- ciding with the devastation wrought by the Russia-Ukraine war and an aggressive U. S. monetary and fiscal tightening effort to dial down inflationquickly spread the pain of a cost-of-living crisis across Americas households. In addition, it casts a new cloud of uncertainty over the near-term outlook for market-rate residential investment. The Push and Pull of Trends: Rentership Rising Broad-stroke household demographics point irrefutably to strong secular demand for multifamily rental apartment development. During the 2022-to-2035 stretch that lies ahead, 275 million adults the total of all the adult-aged generational cohortswill continue to make shelter decisions, especially as U. S. domes- tic migration and mobility continues at over 27 million movers each year. Financial factorsgiven that runaway costs and high mortgage interest rates will price more households out of homeownership as an optionwill determine many of their decisions, as has long been the case. What is different over the past several years has been growth in discretionary rental households, also known as rent-by-choice households. According to Harvards Joint Center for Housing Studies (JCHS), the number of renters making at least $75,000 jumped by 48 percent over the decade ending just before the pandemic, to 11.3 million. With this increase, the share of renter households in this income group rose from 20 percent to 26 percent. Younger, older, and more economically, racially, and culturally diverse households together will bend the economic and cultural arc of rentership upward. Apartment industry leaders now recognize a blurring of behav- ioral lines across generations. When it comes to housing type need or preference, generational cohortsgeneration Z, millen- nials, generation X, and empty-nester baby boomersact more like each other than not.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!84:  46 65 G Exhibit 2-9 Reasons Renters Continue to Rent, Based on Rental Households That Believe Homeownership Is Important Exhibit 2-10 Footprint Allocated to the Homes Outdoor Space, 2021 versus 2020 58 47 67 35 Need to save for downpayment Life circumstances Cannot afford mortgage payments 37 34 Lack of supply 28 11 Require the exibility to move if desiredneeded Cannot take on the maintenance responsibilities 19 16 Would rather spend money on other things 13 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Source: New Home Trends Institute by John Burns Real Estate Consulting LLC.

Buyers are also searching for the right community. With such high levels of new residents, a CEO of an amenity planning and lifestyle design company noted how amenities played a more direct role in connections. New residents want to be con- nectedespecially via the outdoorswith their neighbors and amenity programming. Lifestyle directors can make an outsized impact in new communities. Her focus for new communities is to make outdoor spaces livable all year long, with heating and cooling elements to make residents comfortable. Historically, affordability has played a key role in housing pur- chase decisions, and the rise in home prices along with higher mortgage rates has brought affordability to the forefront. Over 67 percent of households who rent cite the lack of a down payment as the biggest hurdle to homeownership. Builders have always struggled to provide affordable housing, but the rise in the cost of materials over the past two years has impeded any progress. However, some builders are starting to report lower costs especially laboras the market cools.

The bill contains a flood of rules and regulations. For example, new buildings are to be emission-free and have a photovoltaic system from 2028. In addition, emissions are to be calculated over the life cycle for new buildings. For renovations, photovoltaic systems are to be mandatory from 2032. Oil and gas heating systems are to be replaced in major renovations. The recently presented national bill to amend the Building Energy Act pursues similar goals. From 2024, heating systems in new buildings and renovations are to be based on 65 renewable energies. In addition, the German government plans to make it mandatory to replace heating systems that are 30 years old. The 2014 Energy Saving Ordinance already contained a similar provision, and since 2015 there has been an obligation to replace constant-temperature boilers. The modern boilers significantly reduced consumption, which often made the investment worthwhile. With the replacement now required in favor of a heat pump or a district heating, rapid amortization is likely to be difficult. An exchange obligation without generous national support might meet substantial resistances. Often, however, little attention is paid to the numerous exceptions in both the European and the national draft legislation. The European text allows exceptions for listed buildings, and national governments can also make exceptions to the obligation to install photovoltaic systems. In addition, there are several formulations such as if this is technically and economically feasible. The national draft law contains the word if possible. So there should be exceptions. Owners over 80 years of age can stick with fossil-fuel heating systems when replacing their heating systems. In addition, the legislation provides for hardship provisions and funding opportunities. These details show that the legislator is aware of the enormous challenge. The Modernization Package for Climate Protection and Planning Acceleration passed at the end of March also takes this into account. Greater openness to technology was agreed. For example, not only heat pumps are to be permitted, but also infrared and hybrid heating systems, such as a bivalent heat pump with a gas condensing boiler.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2023_Housing_market_outlook__Price_dip_and_interes.pdf-!42:  Likewise, manufacturers could improve heat pump efficiency. The high level of political will, the high and long-term growth in demand and the provision of billions in subsidies give manufacturers planning security and also make research and further development attractive. The annual coefficient of performance, which measures the ratio of thermal energy to electrical energy, could increase significantly. In practice, many heat pumps currently have an annual performance factor of around 3. In the future, modern heat pumps could have significantly higher values. Furthermore, the shortage of skilled workers and numerous countermeasures are discussed intensively in the study Building Strategy Climate Neutrality 2045. These range from education and training to increasing the quota of women, which is currently less than 1, to targeted immigration. The planned immigration law based on the Canadian model could be an 15 April 21, 2023 Germany Monitor in days Air-Water-HP Brine-Water-HP Gas Biomass District heating SFH MFH 14.5 27.8 18.3 34.1 5.0 6.9 8.0 12.4 4.0 6.2 2023 Housing market outlook Market prices for air-to-water heat pump with 10 kW 36 EUR in k 20 15 10 5 0 2005100 240 210 180 150 20 08 10 12 14 16 18 Sources: Deutsche Bank Research, MAP-Frderflle.

In addition, a federal support program started in April 2023. Over a period of 30 months, more than 40,000 craftsmen and energy consultants are to learn how to master the new technology. Several hundred euros per training or coaching session and a maximum of EUR 5,000 per applicant will be made available for this. In addition, the German Heat Pump Association considers the targets to be feasible, which is particularly positive in view of its overly cautious sales forecasts in the past.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!39:  But the need to retrofit for the future, as one real estate adviser points out, provides another set of opportunities that may be more limited in scope but ultimately broader in scale. Owners and managers of real estate will need to enhance the resilience of their assets against potential climate change impacts or otherwise decarbonize their assets as increasingly demanded by tenants, investors, and regulators, as we discuss in greater detail below. But whether a full-scale conversion to another land use or a more limited retrofit to higher building standards, there is a compelling sustainability reason for these projects beyond their potential financial feasibility. It has been said that the greenest building is one that is already built. Simply, it is far more sustain- able for the planet to reuse existing buildings than to build new ones. Reason enough to encourage landowners to consider what reuse options exist before demolishing buildings to make way for new construction. 7. Rewardsand Growing Painsin the Sun Belt  Despite their continued popularity among residents, employ- ers, tenants, and investors, some Sun Belt markets are experiencing growing pains. Big city problems are coming to these markets known for their affordability and quality of life after years of continuous economic and population growth.  These destination markets typically offer lower tax rates and lighter regulatory burdens than many gateway markets, heightening their appeal to many businesses. Conversely, some of these attractive characteristics may limit their capac- ity to accommodate continued massive population inflows.  These markets will remain popular for both business and residential in-migration but could see the pace of both occur at more moderate levels. A growing number of developers are honing the skills required to understand which buildings are most amenable to trans- formation at a feasible price point and to undertake the complexities of conversions. Conversions to residential units Everyone still likes the hot Sun Belt markets. Almost all the Emerging Trends magnet markets that shone most brightly in our last reportthe large Super Sun Belt metro areas and the fastest-growing Supernovasstill shine luminously in the 20 CRE galaxy, as we detail in the Markets to Watch chapter. But another year of hypergrowth has brought growing pains and has slightly dimmed the outlook for some star markets, as indicated by this years survey.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2023_Housing_market_outlook__Price_dip_and_interes.pdf-!43:  In view of the numerous pro and con arguments and the scant data available, it remains unclear from an analytical perspective whether the 6 million target will be achieved in 2030. Not only supply bottlenecks but also insufficient demand could stand in the way of achieving the target. The introduction and enforcement of regulatory laws are politically explosive. Moreover, a simple subsidy is unlikely to close a potential demand gap. Prices for air-to-water heat pumps have roughly doubled in the last 15 years. The state subsidy therefore probably flowed primarily to the manufacturers of heat pumps and not to the property owners. In addition to the replacement of heating systems, the focus is on the building envelope. Although the Building Energy Act provides regulations for the thermal transmittance coefficient, which measures a building's heat output to the outside, these typically reflect the current technology standards of the building components. Thus, the legal requirements are much less challenging than the heat pump target. 5.3 Price differences between low and high emission buildings Low-emission buildings arguably already command price premiums. For example, in the summer of 2021 price indices for existing and new homes were similar. By contrast, in February 2023 there was a 14 difference. Taking into account energy-related refurbishment costs for existing properties is likely to explain the divergence. During the housing boom the state of renovation and the energy certificates played a much smaller role. Today, properties that have not been refurbished or have been refurbished to a minor extent are regularly traded at a discount. In the long term, the discount is likely to increase. On the supply side, the shortage of labor and skilled workers is likely to intensify over the decade as a whole. As a result, the ambitious new construction and refurbishment targets will be difficult to achieve. On the demand side, the rise in energy prices and the consideration of the costs of climate change are likely to lead to a shift away from buildings with high emissions and toward low-emission buildings. The CO2 tax is already making energy costs more expensive. In the next few years, the EU taxonomy will require larger companies and institutional investors to publish their ESG footprint annually. The way companies generate profits will thus come into focus.;\n***\n[Submission]: Solar panels work by converting sunlight into electricity.

B and C value-add investments suit a growing market of younger and mid-career households stuck in the limbo of scarce supply, high prices, and high interest mortgages that will delay their becoming homeowners. Closing a gaping, and widening, chasm in new investment and development would well serve households in the 80 to 120 percent range of area median household income levels the wage range of many essential workers such as teachers, sanitation workers, law enforcement officers, and fire and medical first responders. Furthermore, addressing this missing middle household income level does not preclude the need for additions to and preservation of properties for lower-income households. The Great Bottleneck: Local Ballot Boxes Apartment stakeholders number-one nemesis, blocking private- sector market solutions to deep and growing mismatches between demand and supply, is a many-headed hydraa bevy of deep-rooted restrictive land use, permitting, and regulatory cost burdens that thwart higher-density multifamily develop- ment. On top of these longstanding challenges, a growing push for rent regulation is adding uncertainty to the market. For example, while 26 states prohibit local municipalities from implementing rent control laws, five states permit localities to enforce rent controlNew York, New Jersey, California, Oregon, and Marylandas well as Washington, D. C. Regulations being proposed throughout the country would allow landlords to boost monthly rents by no more than 2 percent to 10 percent. Arizona, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, Washington, and Massachusetts have all introduced proposals to add or expand rent control protections. The problem of impact fees and NIMBYism really dominates many markets and makes it too expensive to develop, the CEO of one of the nations largest property management organizations says. I think were still stuck in the past. Some policymakers are not in tune. Voters who may not be well versed in these issues elect government officials who then become a huge wall to economic solutions. I dont see solutions for all this happening in my lifetime.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!82:  45 Today, the single-family housing industry is on the other side of the rapid run-up in demand and pricesinflation and the rapid escalation of mortgage rates have resulted in a cooldown of the for-sale housing market. Every housing metric is indicating a softening, and builders are starting to recalibrate their business plans in the face of slowing demand. As the housing market resets, we should start to witness the true impact of the pan- demic on home design, location preferences, amenities, and financial preferences. How People Live Home offices and flex spaces are nothing new, but the desire for more functional spaces grew tremendously during the pan- demic-related lockdowns. Builders have not had time to create new designs, but they are modifying current ones. The CEO of a large private homebuilder noted that consumers prefer a higher bedroom count , so in many instances he is choosing existing plans with those features. His team also puts in reading nooks and drop zones where they can, often using space taken away from larger spaces. Architects are reporting similar adjustments. Three significant trends include the following:  More function in the same-sized home. Spaces added include an extra bedroom and additional flex or office spaces. To fit in the extra functions, architects are taking space from typically large areas like the kitchen or dining room and right-sizing the home office and making additional flex spaces that serve as additional work space.  Balance between public and private spacesopen great rooms are not going away. Instead, they are being paired with more private spaces like prep kitchens, drop zones, retreats, and nooks.  Outdoor spaces taking a larger share of space and home- owner spending. This often takes the form of nodessmall patios, decks, and balconies off the primary living areas instead of relying on one larger yard. Despite the overwhelming desire for outdoor and indoor space, density continues to rise as a way to improve affordability. Over 62 percent of architectural designers for production builders are working on denser projects in 2022, compared with only 10 percent with lower-density projects.;\n\nreal_estate_index:outlook-real-estatet-market-germany-dec-2022.pdf-!8:  Although these and possibly upcoming decisions will not have an effect on the number of completions in the short term, in the medium term they could significantly boost construction activity in rental housing. We think it is conceivable that 400,000 flats per year will actually be completed in the next legislative period. But even then it would still take years to reduce the accumulated surplus demand. In the short term, therefore, policymakers could further tighten rent regulation to at least alleviate the symptoms of the housing shortage. For example, at the end of November Hamburg proposed legislation to introduce a cap on index-linked rents. Because more landlords are currently relying on such index-linked rents, we believe that their tighter regulation is a scenario that landlords should prepare for. As stronger regulation acts as a barrier to market entry, such and similar regulatory interventions reinforce the defensive investment character of residential real estate. They cap the potential for rental growth, but precisely because of this they have the effect of tightening supply and thus ensure very secure and stable returns. For risk-averse investors, the market thus remains attractive in principle. Against the backdrop of the climate targets for the German building stock, which have so far been missed by a wide margin, regulatory pressure could also increase here. A range of measures is conceivable, from renovation incentives to usage bans, as already exists in other European countries. These no longer only affect the income side, but also the cost side and thus represent a completely different kind of risk. This risk can only be eliminated with the purchase of new buildings or energy- efficient renovated existing buildings, so risk-averse investors are likely to focus even more on this part of the market. Should regulatory interventions actually take place that force the owners of older stock to refurbish, the bureaucratic and financial effort involved would presumably be too much for smaller landlords in particular. Many of them could then withdraw from the market in favour of larger landlords and initiate a consolidation process.

To be fair, building owners and developers may also leverage a host of new incentives from federal, state, and local govern- ments, including billions of dollars in the Inflation Reduction Act, to help buildings hit these aggressive climate goals. But these carrots only underscore that the industry faces an increasingly challenging set of environmental regulations. ESG Disclosures So Far A recent survey conducted by RCLCO shows both the progress and potential for greater industry participation. As of June 2022, 38 percent of real estate companies report having policies in place to integrate ESG considerations into the investment pro- cess. But adoption varies widely by type of firm, with generally much higher levels from public companies and institutional investors than private companies . ESG disclosure will be costly, requiring not only capital improve- ments in buildings to reduce carbon impacts but also the systems to measure them and the staff to comply with the proliferation of reporting requirements. Those costs could favor larger, better-capitalized investors, leading to more industry con- solidation. Concludes one senior investment banker, Its clear theres going to have to be far more disclosure around carbon footprints and related issues, which is going to inure to the ben- efit of larger, more established REITs and market participants who can meet that disclosure obligation and have the resources to address the carbon offsets or other measures. Regulation to Address Housing Affordability and Blight Rent control. Regulation is something that should be top of mind for a lot of property owners. And were starting to see significantly more rent control laws being passed at the local and municipal levels. That does have trickle-down impacts to individual property owners. That warning comes from the head of advisory services for a real estate data analytics firm. As shelter costs increasingly strain household budgets, some state and local governments are resorting to regulation to address affordability. This takes two primary forms: limits on how much landlords can increase rents and imposing costs on owners who keep units empty.;\n***\n[Submission]: No, the existing regulations related to individual property taxation are not driving the present trend towards bigger homes.\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

Investors should receive similar ex ante returns for similar risks, or else any free lunches will be arbitraged away. In practice, private market real estate pricing tends to be impacted by broader capital market shifts mainly when there are changes in the cost of real estate debt, since the marginal buyer of income-producing real estate is most often a leveraged buyer. When debt costs rise, the market thins before price pressures are reflected in transactions. This tends to create a time lag between higher interest rates and declines in private equity real estate pricing. In most markets globally, we are now feeling the impact of more expensive real estate debt, which in many cases is no longer accretive to returns at current private market valuations. The math of debt costs and going-in yields is relentless. When the yield starting point is especially low in absolute terms, modest increases in debt costs and yields as measured in basis points mathematically translate into big percentage changes in capital values. As such, evidence of the most significant repricing to date has been concentrated in the lowest- yielding sectors, where transactions have held up most. This has surprised some observers since these low-yielding property types are mostly the winning sectors of recent years and they continue to possess attractive growth profiles. That some of the largest recent value declines may be occurring in the most sought- after property types, such as logistics and residential, might come as a shock after years of banner outperformance, especially during the pandemic. Even so, these property types remain the strongest performers over longer trailing periods and values have also fallen in the less favored sectors, although such adjustments are masked by lower price transparency in these property types. This repricing has been labeled mechanical by some because it is a function of exogenous debt assumptions increasing in investors spreadsheets.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!14:  An alternative way to look at it is that it is mechanical because debt pricing is a mechanism by which real estate is linked to the broader capital markets, through lenders cost of funds. Another such mechanism is the denominator effect. This involves comparing real-time values from public markets to lagging valuation-based assessments of private market portfolios, causing some investors to conclude that they are suddenly overweight in the unlisted assets compared to their target allocation. Either way, the downward direction of the pricing pressure is clear and it will likely persist as long as the all-in cost of debt is dilutive to leveraged returns. Given the same inputs, the math works the same way all over the world. But today those inputs to the math vary greatly, depending on local circumstances. In Japan, debt costs have moved far less than in other parts of the world, as inflation remains subdued and the Bank of Japan continues to exercise yield curve control . By contrast, Europes real estate yield starting point was exceptionally low and market interest rates have moved up much more markedly, making the math that much more impactful. Government policy also matters. As central banks seek to choke off inflation by tightening monetary policy, there is at least the reasonable expectation that some of that inflation will be passed into rents and thus property cash flows. But when governments employ long-term borrowing to bail out energy consumers in the short term, as is necessary in Europe, interest rates are pushed up further and the impact on property values may be more detrimental. As the UKs recent experience would suggest, credit markets can react swiftly to reflect changes in perceived debt sustainability.

Europe Singapore Japan United Kingdom Australia Canada Source: Bloomberg. As of November 30, 2022. LOOKING AHEAD  The relentless math of higher interest rates will continue to weigh heavily on real estate values, at least until interest rates stabilize as inflation begins to subside. The bid- ask spread for private real estate should eventually close and transactions will resume in earnest at a rebased level.  In the meantime, investment styles that are less sensitive to volatility in values should be contemplated, such as floating-rate lending with a comfortable cushion from lower loan-to-value ratios. Debt investment can be attractive at times of uncertainty, as investors tilt toward contractually certain income and away from an uncertain upside. Portfolio aggregation strategies with smaller asset sizes that lend themselves to averaging-in with diversified timing of entry points represent another way to cope with volatile and uncertain values.  The inputs to the math are not changing to the same degree in every part of the world. Wherever rate spikes are less intense, or the prospects for rental growth are clearest, transaction activity and prices have been less impacted.  In addition to debt costs, investors should also consider the trajectory of cash flows, which depend on economic fundamentals and real estate occupier market conditions. The differential prospects for real estate cash flows are the subject of the next section.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!16:  G LO BA L 2 The path of fundamentals will ultimately help determine where values settle Early in 2022, we framed the impact of rising inflation and interest rates on values as a race between debt costs and net operating income growth, as we anticipated that higher inflation would translate into higher rents in some sectors. Currently, it seems that debt costs are mostly winning the race. Ultimately, however, valuations are the result of the interaction between higher debt costs and the path of real estate fundamentals, the prospects for which vary widely across sectors and geographies. Tracing back real estate cash flows to their drivers is to follow a chain of causation back to basic variables like population, GDP, industrial production, consumer spending and employment. All of these interact with real estate factors, such as the balance of property supply and occupier demand, to influence property cash flows. Secular megatrends and structural features like legal and contractual constraints also matter. Going into 2023, there is increased uncertainty in many of these variables, especially the economic ones, given the pace of economic expansion is expected to be weaker or negative. This will have a cooling impact on property NOI growth, but nuances remain given that the transmission of macroeconomic conditions to real estate is a winding path. Starting with the underlying economic fundamentals, we are seeing a great deal of variation globally. In addition to the dimensions of depth and duration, a key uncertainty surrounding the coming downturn is how widespread it will be. Europe faces especially severe challenges stemming from an energy price shock, with ripple effects of unknown global scope. The dominant driver of inflation in the US, Canada and Singapore is that their economies are robust and operating close to full capacity. Demand- led inflation is relatively benign compared to inflation from a supply shock, but the central banks in these countries must still raise interest rates, either to manage their domestic economic situations or because their monetary policies are linked to the US Federal Reserve . Rising interest rates create clear risks to economic growth, with housing markets already being impacted by higher mortgage rates. Europes employment picture is also solid, but in addition to home-grown inflation, it is coping with a severe, energy-driven supply shock caused by the Russia-Ukraine war.;\n***\n[Submission]: No, higher debt costs are not the only determinant of real estate valuations.

In reaction, the Ministry of Finance intervened in the FX market for the first time since 1998 to stabilize the currency. Page 4 of 8 The other would focus on fundamentals, and argue that even at a lower entry yield the potential for income growth over the investment period can mitigate some of the value depreciation from rising rates. We would side with the second argument. First, risk should define the yield. This means that assets with a higher risk profile will need to adjust to an even higher yield to maintain a risk premium over more core assets. And second, in a period of high inflation, the value of the income of an asset will erode unless it can generate rental growth. Higher yielding assets generally come from sectors with weak occupational demand, hence the risk of void periods and negative rental growth are much higher, particularly during a period of economic stress. Sectors including life sciences, student accommodation, cold storage logistics and self- storage where there are strong structural drivers to support rental growth, are expected to see the greatest value protection. This was welcome news for markets. While unlikely to change the JPY direction, we take comfort that both the government and the BoJ are on the same page. First, this helps to buy time until the US Fed softens its hawkish stance. Second, there is also a positive implication that the next BoJ governor due to be appointed in April 2023 will not deviate materially. To be clear, an exit from the ultra-loose policy is possible in the medium-term. However, it will most likely be done in a gradual manner. For 2023, at least, the current policy should stay and the chances are even higher now that the peak of global inflation and interest rates are drawing close. Will Japan remain an outlier market with low interest rates? With VC funding slowing, what is the outlook for life sciences real estate? Based on data from Pitchbook,global venture capital invested into life sciences companies in 2022 is set to fall by around 25 on the volume recorded in 2021.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!34:  Economic growth in China in 2023 should be below historical averages, but strong enough to make it one of the fastest growing large economies. In Japan, yield curve control comes at the cost of a weak yen. If the Bank of Japan (BoJ) remains committed to keeping interest rates near zero, currency intervention, such as yen-buying to prevent further depreciation, could be on the table again. However, currency intervention has rarely been successful absent the cooperation from other central banks. Any changes to the yield control approach are likely to come after BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kurodas term concludes in April 2023. Nonetheless, most of the challenges Japan is facing are externally driven, while domestic-driven fundamentals remain relatively healthy. Australia, South Korea and Singapore are the most directly impacted by rising interest rates in the West. The outlook of these economies is likely to follow AP.1 Diverging monetary policies in Asia Pacific the trends in the West, albeit to varying degrees. The Monetary Authority of Singapore manages monetary policies through the foreign exchange markets, given that for a small and open economy, the exchange rate has a much stronger influence on inflation than the interest rate. That said, the magnitude of interest rate hikes in Singapore has been less than that of the US. Additionally, an increasing number of firms are pivoting to Singapore for their regional headquarters due to its geopolitical stability. All of these are adding to the relative strength of Singapores economy. The weakness of Asia Pacific currencies is mostly a story of US dollar strength. Nevertheless, uncertainties over the macro outlook and the dispersion among regional economies could lead to the continuing divergence of real estate market performance in the next 12-24 months.

For example, owners who are forced to sell assets because they are unable to refinance debt or need to sell for other reasons, such as generating liquidity quickly. In such situations, sellers may be willing to accept below-market prices, or indeed have to, in order to facilitate a sale. For investors wanting to deploy capital now, holding off for a few months as pricing adjusts is probably the best strategy. Given the higher interest rate environment, we also think that floating rate real estate debt is an attractive way to achieve strong inflation protected returns and generate a good income return from real estate. Finally, looking across the globe, another potential opportunity for investors in 2023 is Japan, due to accretive hedging gains for investment into this market. Indeed, investors need to be mindful of large differences in monetary policy as interest rate differentials between countries determine the cost of hedging. Currently, Japan is particularly attractive on an after-hedging basis, since interest rates there are lower than in other markets. Page 3 of 8 What opportunities exist for investors in 2023? Which markets and sectors are the most defensive? There are two schools of thought in answering this question. One would argue that higher yielding assets offer greater value protection as they have a wider spread to the rising bond yields, and in some cases leverage can still be accretive. Yes, we think so. Japans economic recovery has lagged. The labor market improved in 2022, but is still soft relative to 2019. October inflation at 3.6 was the highest in four decades, but modest versus other countries. The pressure was also largely imported while domestic inflation stayed benign. In that context, maintaining the loose monetary policy appears the right thing to do. However, something has to give due to this diverging policy stance versus elsewhere.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, it is correct to say that while Japan is facing externally driven challenges, it is expected to maintain stable monetary policies with the Bank of Japan keeping interest rates near zero, thereby ensuring the spread between property yields and the risk-free rate remains intact .\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

According to a company spokesperson, Jamestowns program does not expose them, or their investors, to cryptocurrency volatility, as the firm works with an exchange agent to facilitate the conversion of cryptocurrency to cash for payment of rent.77 The confluence of digital assets has led to some experimentation with the conversion of real assets to digital tokens, such as the Bahnhofstrasse building in Zurich,78 and Britains Greenwich Peninsula project owned by Hong Kong SARs Henry Cheng.79 While these proofs of concept demonstrated the art of the possible in real estate tokenization, the combination of recent disruption in cryptocurrency markets along with regulatory uncertainty may have kept a lid on the growth of real estate tokenization. For example, US regulators have taken divergent views on how digital assets should be treated: as currencies, commodities, securities, or taxable property.80 Nevertheless, the promise of tokenizationmore efficient processing and the ability to tap into a large retail investor basesuggests that real estate leaders should keep an eye on this developing trend.

Net-zero disclosure requirements are expected to increase, which will put pressure on landlords to offer ways of tracking energy consumption and carbon emissions by tenant. To do this, asset owners may opt to develop a digital twin of their asset that collects real time information from thousands of sensors in the building. Governments will ramp up subsidies to incentivize less wasteful development and greener buildings. The largest government programs spend subsidies via the private lending community that will do a green assessment in exchange for lower financing costs at origination. However, we may see increased pressure by regulators to also monitor the asset during the loans life, further increasing the need for a standard tech solution. The sector is also captive for taxation when governments eventually look to pay down debts built up over the pandemic. We think that caution is needed to ensure that investors do not pay excessive prices, as strong investor demand has driven risk premiums lower, and to be sure that rental growth assumptions are achievable. Overall though, we think the party for industrial investors will continue into 2023. How should investors position their portfolios? To set the scene, UBS Investment Bank expects a historically weak macro outlook in 2023, and that the advanced economies will suffer a shallow recession. Their annual GDP is forecast to grow just 0.4  the weakest since 1982 excluding the pandemic and Global Financial Crisis.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!3:  And 5. Technology, which has expanded every year as proptech applications have revolutionized the management and valuation tools used by practitioners. Prospective: In the year 2025 The lessons of the early 1990s are clear: real estate down-cycles do not last forever. Reflecting on the frightening memories of plummeting values, empty buildings, bankruptcies and the Resolution Trust Corporation , suggests that the current round of credit tightening is likely to pale in comparison. The 2023 edition of LaSalles ISA Outlook anticipates the impacts of the rising cost of credit, a stall in economic growth and a pause in the multi-decade pattern of real estate appreciation. However, it does not extrapolate these trends far into the future. The human tendency to latch onto a few pieces of information and to expect that a narrow set of recent facts will shape future events is known as anchoring bias. When investing in a long-duration asset class like real estate, a longer-term, holistic view is more valuable. In 2014, the apocalyptic visions of German film director, Fritz Langs 1927 masterpiece Metropolis were put alongside the 1960s rock song 2525. The irony of bringing together dark images from one era, while listening to music from another, through the technology of a more recent YouTube artist is symbolic of how imperfectly clever we are at predicting the future. The eerily weird Lang-2525 juxtaposition implicitly illustrates how resilient humanity can be, even while contemplating what seem like existential threats such as fascism, industrialization and robots in the 1920s, nuclear holocausts in the 1960s. Financial panics in the 1990s and again in 2008-2010 and climate change and geopolitical conflict in the 2020s. Josef Schumpeter is most well-remembered for popularizing the term creative destruction. He is less remembered for his work on democratic theory. To Schumpeter, democracy is the mechanism for competition among political parties in a market- like framework.;\n***\n[Submission]: Answer: Blockchain technology is a digital ledger system that records and stores data in a secure and immutable way. It is used to track and store transactions, such as cryptocurrency payments, and can also be used to store other types of data, such as real estate records. Blockchain technology is also being used to develop new applications, such as digital twins of real estate assets, which can be used to track energy consumption and carbon emissions by tenants . It is also being used to facilitate virtual property transactions in the metaverse . In the future, blockchain technology may be used to facilitate taxation of real estate assets  and to create a market-like framework for democratic competition .\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

After more than a decade of lower for longer, the Fed is finally normalizing interest rates closer to historical levels. Those rising interest rates are already driving up debt costs and thus the costs to acquire and develop property, reducing leveraged returns. At the same time, the federal government is done with providing stimulus, indirectly reducing tenant demand for space. Unlike in the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and during the pandemic, nobodys coming to the rescue, and now we got to take our medicine, and here it comes, says the head of research for an investment management firm. Thus, the government is turning off both the monetary and fiscal spigots that had been support- ing commercial real estate and the economy overall. The head of a development company summarized it like this: I feel like weve been on a little bit of a sugar high with this stimu- lus and cheap debt. Theres going to be a slowdown. Theres got to be this normalization. So, what does that mean? I think its going to be a little bouncy. Its going to be a little bit turbulent. But then we bottom out, and we start back into growth. 2.  Still, Weve Changed Some  The pandemic forced structural shifts in how and where we live, work, and recreate in ways that seem destinated to endure.  Online spending is receding from its pandemic peaks but is not likely to revert to pre-pandemic levels. Business travel is unlikely to recover to pre-COVID levels for at least several years, meaning business hotels, fine dining, and conference facilities will continue to face challenges.  The greatest changes may be in how and where we work. The impact on office use and leasing is still evolving, and a significant share of the existing stock may need to be reposi- tioned to remain competitive.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!9:  Defying just about every prediction voiced during the terrifying and uncertain days of the COVID lockdown that began in March 2020, U. S. commercial property markets actually embarked on a remarkable run, with some of the strongest returns, rent growth, and price appreciation rates ever recorded. Not every property type, however: hotels endured their worst and most sustained downturn in memory, while offices suffered an unprecedented and significant cut in usage of space. And not every market: some of the nations strongest gateway mar- kets, like New York City and San Francisco, experienced sharp outflows of residents, businesses, and tenants of all types. But overall and across much of the United States, property markets far outperformed expectations and historical norms. And now, more than two years on, property investors and managers are learning anew that whopping growth and profits eventually fall back to eartha reversion to the mean, to use finance jargon, or simply normalizing, as numerous industry experts we interviewed put it. Some looming market adjustments will be cyclical due to the weakening economic conditions that most economists and real estate professionals expect, while others represent more of a return to normalcy after all the pandemic-fueled market distortions. These market reversions will take several forms: prices of most assets are declining as cap rates rise and transaction volumes fall from record levels, while rent gains for others are merely moderating as demand returns to more sustainable levels. Perhaps the biggest surprise is that these reversals of fortune are hitting favored property sectors like multifamily and indus- trial. That does not necessarily mean the market corrections will be painful. In many cases, recent losses in property value will only trim already healthy gains. But many indicators suggest that the (really) good times may be over, at least for a while. Housing Set to Cool A finance executive with one national homebuilder told us, Were still selling. Its just not at the pace that it was selling before the last two years, which was a pace that you dont typi- cally see. So, the markets are more normalizing.;\n\nreal_estate_index:global-real-estate-markets-2023.pdf-!1:  We also dive into student housing in the US, another sector booming among investors, and what impact demographic trends might have on it. In addition, we analyze how opportunistic and value-add managers will need to adopt their strategies now that interest rates are higher, and how their ability to generate out-size returns simply by adding leverage is gone. So, a number of important topics for us and investors to consider. We hope you find our answers insightful and useful in determining your strategy and thinking about some of the key questions in real estate as we move into the new year. Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy. Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs. We have already started to see cap rates and yields rise in many markets, with the most rapid adjustment taking place in the UK. However, we do not think that prices fully reflect higher interest rates yet. To assess when values might bottom out, we can look to past downturns and the listed market for guidance. In the Global Financial Crisis, for example, global capital values bottomed out in 4Q09, while GDP across global real estate markets troughed three quarters earlier, in 1Q09, as did global listed real estate prices1. Market downturns usually present opportunities, and one we expect for investors in 2023 is a correction in pricing as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. Although we do not expect large amounts of distress in the market, we do expect some, already apparent in parts of the UK market. This should allow investors access to assets at attractive pricing. The early 1990s downturn was longer, with US capital values continuing to decline into 1995. We expect modest declines in GDP in the first half of 2023 before growth resumes.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!15: 5 Spiking rates drive rapid tightening of financial conditions Cost of capital rising sharply in most geographies Nominal corporate bond yields 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 7 0 n a J 8 0 n a J 9 0 n a J 0 1 n a J 1 1 n a J 2 1 n a J 3 1 n a J 4 1 n a J 5 1 n a J 6 1 n a J 7 1 n a J 8 1 n a J 9 1 n a J 0 2 n a J 1 2 n a J 2 2 n a J US C.

LOOKING AHEAD  The relentless math of higher interest rates will continue to weigh heavily on real estate values, at least until interest rates stabilize as inflation begins to subside. The bid- ask spread for private real estate should eventually close and transactions will resume in earnest at a rebased level.  In the meantime, investment styles that are less sensitive to volatility in values should be contemplated, such as floating-rate lending with a comfortable cushion from lower loan-to-value ratios. Debt investment can be attractive at times of uncertainty, as investors tilt toward contractually certain income and away from an uncertain upside. Portfolio aggregation strategies with smaller asset sizes that lend themselves to averaging-in with diversified timing of entry points represent another way to cope with volatile and uncertain values.  The inputs to the math are not changing to the same degree in every part of the world. Wherever rate spikes are less intense, or the prospects for rental growth are clearest, transaction activity and prices have been less impacted.  In addition to debt costs, investors should also consider the trajectory of cash flows, which depend on economic fundamentals and real estate occupier market conditions. The differential prospects for real estate cash flows are the subject of the next section.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, capitalization rates and yields are escalating across various markets, including the UK, due to higher interest rates .\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

Adaptation Key as the Landscape Shifts for Canadian Real Estate What does this mean for real estate companies? For some, it adds further to the need to take a pause on activity. There have been rising projections, for example, of developers delaying or potentially canceling condo projects as it becomes harder to make the numbers work in these challenging conditions. Others are trying to manage this by spacing out advanced sales of new housing units to ensure that prices reflect rising costs as a project moves forward. In some cases, companies are proactively shor- Exhibit 4-2 Real Estate Capital Market Balance Forecast, 2023 versus 2022 Equity capital for investing 2023 27 39 34 2022 3 35 62 Undersupplied In balance Oversupplied Source: Emerging Trends in Real Estate surveys. Note: Based on Canadian respondents only. ing up liquidityeven at higher financing costsas they look to reduce risk amid uncertainty about the availability of capital. While challenging, an environment like this also presents opportu- nities. Companies with less leverage may be able to secure assets at more reasonable prices. And while some sources of financing may be less available than in the past, many interviewees predict that the private debt market will help fill some of the gap. The pause in the market is also a chance to explore solutions to some of the challenges that builders are facing. Some interviewees, for example, touted mass timber as a potential opportunity to get projects built faster, which is key in an environment of rising costs. 2. ESG Performance: A Critical Issue for Canadian Real Estate You can do ESG, and you can get a return. Alternative materials like mass timber also offer important sustainability benefits, which brings us to another critical issue for Canadas real estate industry: ESG performance. There are many factors underpinning the ESG imperative, but a few issues in particular are driving the increased focus for real estate companies now. Key among them is the ability to attract capital.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!46:  In addition, new building could ease off further as construction projects are delayed as they are on the housing front because of a shortage of building materials. New construction projects are also being shelved be- cause of higher financing costs and a sharp rise in the price of materials. Construc- tion costs in the office segment have increased by almost 30 per cent since the end of 2019. Market conditions for the office market The various challenges weighing on the economy have had a major impact on the monthly surveys of economists and companies regarding the current situation and expectations. The financial market experts questioned as part of the ZEW Financial Market Survey see both the current situation and economic expectations deep in negative territory. In contrast, among companies, there is a yawning gap between the current situation and expectations: Whereas companies are still relatively upbeat about the current situation, expectations in the ifo Business Climate Index have vir- tually slumped, pulling the index down overall and leading to an unusually large gap between the current situation and expectations.

New building activity did not start to pick up until 2012 onwards, long after the surge in immigration after the turn of the century. On an aggregated basis across top locations, only around 20,000 homes p. a. were built from 2002 to 2011. Thereafter, completion figures rose to over 50,000 units up until 2018. Rising purchase prices, rental growth and higher investor demand made new builds lucrative. Between 2016 and 2019, building permits for 60,000 flats and more were issued every year, which means that even higher numbers of units could have been built. Instead, however, housing construction has been slowing down again since 2019  falling to around 40,000 units by 2021. Building in towns and cities was hampered by the fact that the construction industry was working more or less at capacity, by a shortage of skilled workers and of materials, along with the emergence of protests here and there. Now though, the construction industry faces much stronger head- wind, and consequently, completion figures are likely to decline further. A shortage of materials is being compounded by a rapid rise in construction costs  above all a huge rise in the price of building materials  along with higher financing costs. A 30- year average shows that the cost of new build flats has increased by a good 3 per cent p. a. The increase in costs in 2018 and 2019 was considerably higher, but since 2021, it has been unprecedented: Construction costs rose by around 9 per cent in 2021 and, in the first half of 2022, they rose by almost 16 per cent! The cost of reno- vation has risen on a similar scale.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-12-12_ABG_Statements_Hoeller_2022-2023_en.pdf-!2:  Moreover, opportunistic investors, especially from the Anglo-Saxon countries, will reposition themselves in view of the expected market shakeout. In this context, they will also focus their considerations on the German market. This development can already be observed today. 2. Current trends and developments Ulrich Hller on the shortage of skilled workers: The shortage of skilled workers has turned into a serious business risk in the construction industry as well. At the beginning of 2022, in a survey by the Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry , 78 per cent of construction companies identified the shortage of skilled workers as the main risk to their own economic development. In 2010, by contrast, it was only 21 per cent. Labour costs have always been very important in the personnel-intensive construction industry. Here, only changes in the legal framework can produce relief: Germany urgently needs an efficient and targeted immigration law that provides the economy with significantly more qualified and motivated workers who want to learn and prove themselves. Ulrich Hller on the ESG topic: The number one subject of discussion in 2021 was the implementation of ESG requirements. Even though it was pushed into the background in 2022, this will return to be the prevailing topic in the future. The issue of climate protection, decarbonisation and the required reduction of the CO2 footprint presents us with dramatically growing challenges around the globe. This is particularly true for the real estate sector, which accounts for almost 40 per cent of CO2 emissions worldwide. We will only be able to meet this challenge if we really move all levers at our disposal to address the issue seriously and with conviction. This also holds true for investors, especially as ESG suitability currently still means lower returns, and it remains to be seen who is willing to take this route under the present challenging conditions. Moreover, there will be a greater emphasis of the S and the G  the social 2 and governance components. I think the real estate industry still has a lot of work to do in this respect, and there are significant opportunities for it to position itself.

Schumpeters viewpoints were shaped by being an escapee of both the rise of fascism in 1930s Germany and of Soviet-style communism of the 1950sregimes that came to power through sham elections. Like the 2525 video, reading Schumpeter reminds us how the past, present and future all intersect. Geopolitical events in LaSalles target countries are as difficult to predict as the idiosyncratic motivations of their leaders. As researchers, we cannot know the future, but we can help devise strategies to cope with whatever alternative futures may arise. The forces of nationalism, authoritarianism and a distrust of globalism may represent a temporary triumph of politics over economics. Over the long term, though, the power of open markets remains a force to be reckoned with and not to be underestimated. Likewise, well-constructed and well-located properties can thrive even during periods of great political turmoil. Successful real estate investing rests on identification of timeless attributes that are successful over the course of several cycles. These attributes must be appropriately priced and they must also adapt to trends in demographics, technology, urbanization and environmental factors. This triangle of timelessness, adaptation and fair value pricing forms the foundation for successful real estate investing. As I hand over the reins of LaSalles research to a new generation of researchers, I sense that the past, present and future will continue to intersect and to overlap. The awarding of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Economics was based in part on an analysis of the Great Depression of the 1930s. We have learned much about credit cycles and the role of banks in maintaining or losing confidence in market institutions. At the same time, the events of 2022 in Ukraine and elsewhere show how unpredictable the course of human events can be. The semi-predictable path of rising C02 levels is leading to weather volatility along with rising atmospheric and oceanic temperatures.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!3:  And 5. Technology, which has expanded every year as proptech applications have revolutionized the management and valuation tools used by practitioners. Prospective: In the year 2025 The lessons of the early 1990s are clear: real estate down-cycles do not last forever. Reflecting on the frightening memories of plummeting values, empty buildings, bankruptcies and the Resolution Trust Corporation , suggests that the current round of credit tightening is likely to pale in comparison. The 2023 edition of LaSalles ISA Outlook anticipates the impacts of the rising cost of credit, a stall in economic growth and a pause in the multi-decade pattern of real estate appreciation. However, it does not extrapolate these trends far into the future. The human tendency to latch onto a few pieces of information and to expect that a narrow set of recent facts will shape future events is known as anchoring bias. When investing in a long-duration asset class like real estate, a longer-term, holistic view is more valuable. In 2014, the apocalyptic visions of German film director, Fritz Langs 1927 masterpiece Metropolis were put alongside the 1960s rock song 2525. The irony of bringing together dark images from one era, while listening to music from another, through the technology of a more recent YouTube artist is symbolic of how imperfectly clever we are at predicting the future. The eerily weird Lang-2525 juxtaposition implicitly illustrates how resilient humanity can be, even while contemplating what seem like existential threats such as fascism, industrialization and robots in the 1920s, nuclear holocausts in the 1960s. Financial panics in the 1990s and again in 2008-2010 and climate change and geopolitical conflict in the 2020s. Josef Schumpeter is most well-remembered for popularizing the term creative destruction. He is less remembered for his work on democratic theory. To Schumpeter, democracy is the mechanism for competition among political parties in a market- like framework.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!13: 0 G LO BA L A S I A PAC I F I C E U R O P E N O R T H A M E R I CA G LO BA L - 1 The math of spiking interest rates is driving a repricing of real estate In a completely efficient market, real estate pricing should be closely linked to that of the other asset classes that make up the broader investable universe. Investors should receive similar ex ante returns for similar risks, or else any free lunches will be arbitraged away. In practice, private market real estate pricing tends to be impacted by broader capital market shifts mainly when there are changes in the cost of real estate debt, since the marginal buyer of income-producing real estate is most often a leveraged buyer. When debt costs rise, the market thins before price pressures are reflected in transactions. This tends to create a time lag between higher interest rates and declines in private equity real estate pricing. In most markets globally, we are now feeling the impact of more expensive real estate debt, which in many cases is no longer accretive to returns at current private market valuations. The math of debt costs and going-in yields is relentless. When the yield starting point is especially low in absolute terms, modest increases in debt costs and yields as measured in basis points mathematically translate into big percentage changes in capital values. As such, evidence of the most significant repricing to date has been concentrated in the lowest- yielding sectors, where transactions have held up most. This has surprised some observers since these low-yielding property types are mostly the winning sectors of recent years and they continue to possess attractive growth profiles. That some of the largest recent value declines may be occurring in the most sought- after property types, such as logistics and residential, might come as a shock after years of banner outperformance, especially during the pandemic. Even so, these property types remain the strongest performers over longer trailing periods and values have also fallen in the less favored sectors, although such adjustments are masked by lower price transparency in these property types. This repricing has been labeled mechanical by some because it is a function of exogenous debt assumptions increasing in investors spreadsheets.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!16:  G LO BA L 2 The path of fundamentals will ultimately help determine where values settle Early in 2022, we framed the impact of rising inflation and interest rates on values as a race between debt costs and net operating income growth, as we anticipated that higher inflation would translate into higher rents in some sectors. Currently, it seems that debt costs are mostly winning the race. Ultimately, however, valuations are the result of the interaction between higher debt costs and the path of real estate fundamentals, the prospects for which vary widely across sectors and geographies. Tracing back real estate cash flows to their drivers is to follow a chain of causation back to basic variables like population, GDP, industrial production, consumer spending and employment. All of these interact with real estate factors, such as the balance of property supply and occupier demand, to influence property cash flows. Secular megatrends and structural features like legal and contractual constraints also matter. Going into 2023, there is increased uncertainty in many of these variables, especially the economic ones, given the pace of economic expansion is expected to be weaker or negative. This will have a cooling impact on property NOI growth, but nuances remain given that the transmission of macroeconomic conditions to real estate is a winding path. Starting with the underlying economic fundamentals, we are seeing a great deal of variation globally. In addition to the dimensions of depth and duration, a key uncertainty surrounding the coming downturn is how widespread it will be. Europe faces especially severe challenges stemming from an energy price shock, with ripple effects of unknown global scope. The dominant driver of inflation in the US, Canada and Singapore is that their economies are robust and operating close to full capacity. Demand- led inflation is relatively benign compared to inflation from a supply shock, but the central banks in these countries must still raise interest rates, either to manage their domestic economic situations or because their monetary policies are linked to the US Federal Reserve . Rising interest rates create clear risks to economic growth, with housing markets already being impacted by higher mortgage rates. Europes employment picture is also solid, but in addition to home-grown inflation, it is coping with a severe, energy-driven supply shock caused by the Russia-Ukraine war.;\n***\n[Submission]: Answer: The theory of relativity is a scientific theory developed by Albert Einstein in the early 20th century.

The hottest metro areas may soon face declining demandand potentially an exodus due to unbearable weather, even as households continue to migrate from colder climates to warmer metro areas overall. Large swathes of Texas and the U. S. Southwest have endured 100-degree highs almost every day this summer, with nighttime temperatures frequently not dipping below 80 degrees. And its not confined to just the Southwest. Heat domes have settled over the Pacific Northwest during the past two summers, bring- ing heatwaves unprecedented in their length and intensity. The built environment intensifies climate change as buildings and roads absorb and retain heat. This heat island effect raises not only daytime peaks but especially nighttime tempera- tures, which can be hazardous to humans if they cannot cool down at night. Sun Belt cities like Phoenix and Dallas are work- ing with CRE owners to reduce heat islands by expanding the tree canopy, adding reflective coatings or vegetation to roofs, and using cool pavements to reduce the heat absorption of asphalt streets and concrete sidewalks. These approaches are important and necessary but may ultimately prove inadequate to the challenge if climate change keeps ratcheting up tempera- tures as expected. Beyond the discomfort and health risks of living in ever-hotter climates, energy costs rise with temperatures, as do the risks of power outages as more strain is placed on power grids. A less obvious cost: higher temperatures and ultraviolet exposure can increase building maintenance costs. Extreme weather worsened by climate change is even exacerbating inflation as 24 Exhibit 1-16 Percentage of U. S.

But it also remains questionable to what extent it will be possible to contain or even prevent climate damage through behavioural change, construction measures, precautions and good crisis management. The first indications are provided by the extensive data of the German Weather Service. Schleswig-Holstein, for example, tends to have low average summer temperatures, while BerlinBrandenburg tends to have high average temperatures. Historically, the difference between the two regions has averaged about 1.5C, and in recent years it has even been around 2C. Bavaria and Baden-Wrttemberg tend to have higher temperatures than Schleswig-Holstein, probably due to the higher number of sunshine hours. However, they typically also have higher precipitation, making fires and potential water rationing less likely. It also increases the yield of photovoltaic systems, which in turn could reduce utility costs. In general, it should also be true that low and high mountains tend to have higher soil moisture due to lower evapotranspiration. In contrast, BerlinBrandenburg is a rather dry region with a rather high risk of forest fires. Schleswig-Holstein, on the other hand, may be most affected by rising sea levels or the cost of higher dams. In view of the many influencing factors and the unclear regional effects of climate change, it will probably take several years before these are noticeably reflected in the return considerations of investors.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!29:  The key questions have shifted from the amount of in-person work, to the precise amount and type of space needed to facilitate interaction and collaboration.

Depending on the jurisdiction, the focus varies from the narrower goal of hardening against physical risk, to full decarbonization. European countries are moving at different speeds, but all in the same direction. Policies in US states are diverging based on political dynamics. In Asia Pacific, the trend is mixed. Despite this variation, the events of 2022 have dramatically reinforced the need for action on climate change, both at the macro level of governments and industry and at the micro level of property-specific resilience and futureproofing. Investors should continue to plan and take action to adapt portfolios to evolving climate-related risks. Weather over the past year has almost certainly caused the pile of catastrophic insurance losses to keep mounting . Hurricane Ian was the fifth-strongest hurricane to make landfall in the United States and may prove to be the costliest in history. Severe damage, including complete destruction, has occurred to real estate in the storms path. Even properties that were relatively undisturbed were left cut off from road access, power, internet, water and even mobile service due to damaged infrastructure. A forceful hurricane season in 2022 was preceded by a sweltering summer in the Northern Hemisphere. Europe and China recorded their hottest-ever summers since recordkeeping began in 1880, according to NOAAs National Centers for Environmental Information. Meanwhile, Japan and the US recorded their second- and third-hottest summers, respectively. Knock-on economic effects included the pausing of railway service in Britain and the disruption of goods traffic on rivers in Europe and China due to low water levels.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!47:  NOAAs National Centers for Environmental Information calculates that the annual number of billion-dollar events (inflation-adjusted) in the United States has been increasing rapidly in recent decades, rising from about three per year in the 1980s to over 20 in the 2020s. More disturbing is the increase in severe summer storms, excluding climate events like drought, flooding, and wildfires. The number of billion-dollar severe storms has jumped from less than one per year in the 1980s to 12 in this decadea 15-fold increase in less than 40 years and trending further upward. Just in the recent summer of 2022, we experienced five once-in- a-1,000-year storms in Dallas, Death Valley, central and southern Illinois, Kentucky, and St. Louis, which recorded the most intense rainfall in the citys history. These storms demonstrate that build- ings and infrastructure are poorly equipped to withstand the changing climatemuch less what might be coming. There is still a political divide in the country about what is to blame for climate change, and what, if anything, to do about it. But there is now growing agreement about its prevalence. Fully two-thirds of Americans surveyed by the Pew Research Center in 2021 believe that extreme weather events across the United States occur more often than in the past. Close to half say that it is hitting close to home as their community has recently experienced severe weather like floods and intense storms or long periods of unusually hot weather . Last year in these pages, we highlighted the role of commercial real estate in acceleratingor potentially mitigatingclimate change, in a trend we called Climate Risks Are on Us. Despite recent calls by some CRE leaders that we should deemphasize ESG issues now as we grapple with growing economic threats, many in our industry are continuing to answer societys call to do even more to reduce our carbon footprint. But with climate risks climbing still further, this year we highlight climates impact on us as owners, managers, and users of real propertyand how our industry can proactively address the impacts of climate change on our assets.

S. are undergoing a period of price discovery in response to rising interest rates and underwriting has become more challenging due to greater market volatility. Transaction volumes have slowed as a result. The extent of valuation changes will depend on various factors such as: risk profile, (asset-specific) lease terms, local market fundamentals and sector characteristics.

While it is difficult to assess the direct impact of rising social inequality on real estate markets, an increased focus on affordable housing should generate opportunities. The sunbelt states in the south are expected to outperform the north-east and mid-west rust-belt states due to migration patterns, a tax-friendly environment, and the greater affordability of housing.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!63: 8 Five-year Canada government bond yield: 3.2 6.0 5.5 5.0 4.5 4.0 3.5 3.0 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 Mar-16 Mar-17 Mar-18 Mar-19 Mar-20 Mar-21 Mar-22 US Spread 10-year US Treasury Five-year Canada mortgage rate Canada Spread US conventional secured Five-year Canada government bond yield Notes: US borrowing rates are representative of 10-year loans.

Those characteristics are still in place, and market sentiment toward offices has also changed as the risks are more broadly recognized. Lenders are materially raising spreads and limiting loan proceeds. Moreover, there are few active core buyers, as most have substantial office allocations and have a dim view of the risk-return outlook for the office sector. These factors should lead to equity losses for many office owners and the expected emergence of distressed transactions. We expect office demand to recover slowly, as obsolete buildings are removed due to conversion of use or demolition. Fundamentals and rents will eventually recover, but that is likely years away. Healthy fundamentals sustain many sectors through economic weakness The sector chasm referenced in the global chapter has produced a variety of winners in the North American market.

When new pricing is established, it will provide market evidence to help brokers supply accurate opinions of value and enable sellers to have realistic pricing expectations. But until that occurs, properties will be offered on the hope that aspirational pricing targets anchored on peak levels will be achieved and a bid-ask gap will persist. Our expectation is that transaction activity will be below average in 2023, but start to recover in some sectors later in the year. While unleveraged buyers are not directly impacted by higher interest rates, they are also shifting their pricing and buying activity. They are adjusting their cost of capital in response to the broader capital markets, and unleveraged or low-leverage buyers are capital constrained as well.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!59:  1 2 - c e D 2 2 - n a J 2 2 - b e F 2 2 - r a M 2 2 - r p A 2 2 - y a M 2 2 - n u J 2 2 - u J l 2 2 - g u A 2 2 - p e S 2 2 - t c O 2 2 - v o N Date of forecast GDP Forecast for: US 2023 Canada 2023 US 2024 Canada 2024 Source: Oxford Economics, as of November 16, 2022. around long-term interest rates and pricing than around near-term economic growth and real estate fundamentals. We are reluctant to make investment decisions based solely on a view of future interest rates, but acknowledge that real estate pricing is linked to future interest rates. Given this dynamic, we recommend investors consider a range of interest rate scenarios . Interest rate increases and the relentless math Each time interest rates ticked higher since the GFC, the question of when higher debt costs would impact real estate values was asked. It was a speculative question, with the underlying assumption that rate increases thus far had not yet impacted values. Regardless of the answer then, it became very clear in 2022 that the relentless math of higher borrowing rates was having an impact on leveraged returns and asset values . The boost investors were getting from borrowing has shifted to a drag on a cash basis, but with unleveraged internal rates of return generally above borrowing rates, leverage is still marginally accretive on a total return basis. However, with less lift from borrowing, leveraged buyers are largely out of the market . Higher borrowing rates are a function of both higher indices and increased borrowing spreads. Lending volume is down significantly and lenders are becoming more conservative. The supply of debt capital from large money center banks is down due to large positions taken in the first half of 2022 coupled with stress testing. The Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (CMBS) market continues to be impacted by volatility and life companies are looking into 2023 until fresh allocations become available.;\n***\n[Submission]: Answer: The policy rate of the Bank of Canada is 3.75%, as of October 2022 .\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

UBS Asset Management Weve narrowed it down to A year ago, the world remained in the grips of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Omicron variant had just emerged. 12 months on and the pandemic has largely subsided, only to be replaced by a brutal war in Ukraine and inflation reaching multi-decade highs. This prompted central banks to make aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022, with more expected in 2023, along with a mild recession in the economy. Looking back to our 2022 predictions, in general they proved prescient. We expected hybrid working to weigh on the office market and that the polarization between the best and worst assets would continue, which has been the case. We expected retail capital values to bottom out, which they had started to, but are now likely to be impacted by weakening consumer spending. We said that property investors would no longer be able to rely on market-driven yield compression to drive returns, which has certainly proved accurate as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. In 2023, the environment for real estate looks set to be more challenging, with headwinds coming both from higher interest rates and a weaker economy, which will impact on occupier demand. Against this backdrop, we look at 10 key questions for real estate investors at the turn of the year and how we would approach them. We address ESG questions in our separate publication. Page 2 of 8 Our research team gives answers to some key questions facing real estate investors. To start with, we look at whether real estate prices currently fully reflect the move to higher interest rates and what prospects are for the market going forward. We also highlight opportunities for investors in the current environment, and what their strategy can be. We discuss how they can position their portfolios, and which sectors we think are the most defensive. We then look at prospects for the life sciences sector against a backdrop of slower VC funding. This follows a period of strong growth in the sector and a lot of investor interest.;\n\nreal_estate_index:global-real-estate-markets-2023.pdf-!2:  Overall, we think that global capital values will bottom out in the second half of 2023, with the timing dependent upon how the economy fairs and a longer adjustment possible. 1 According to MSCI Global Quarterly Property Index and FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Index in USD. For example, owners who are forced to sell assets because they are unable to refinance debt or need to sell for other reasons, such as generating liquidity quickly. In such situations, sellers may be willing to accept below-market prices, or indeed have to, in order to facilitate a sale. For investors wanting to deploy capital now, holding off for a few months as pricing adjusts is probably the best strategy. Given the higher interest rate environment, we also think that floating rate real estate debt is an attractive way to achieve strong inflation protected returns and generate a good income return from real estate. Finally, looking across the globe, another potential opportunity for investors in 2023 is Japan, due to accretive hedging gains for investment into this market. Indeed, investors need to be mindful of large differences in monetary policy as interest rate differentials between countries determine the cost of hedging. Currently, Japan is particularly attractive on an after-hedging basis, since interest rates there are lower than in other markets. Page 3 of 8 What opportunities exist for investors in 2023? Which markets and sectors are the most defensive? There are two schools of thought in answering this question. One would argue that higher yielding assets offer greater value protection as they have a wider spread to the rising bond yields, and in some cases leverage can still be accretive. Yes, we think so. Japans economic recovery has lagged. The labor market improved in 2022, but is still soft relative to 2019. October inflation at 3.6 was the highest in four decades, but modest versus other countries. The pressure was also largely imported while domestic inflation stayed benign. In that context, maintaining the loose monetary policy appears the right thing to do. However, something has to give due to this diverging policy stance versus elsewhere.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!9:  Defying just about every prediction voiced during the terrifying and uncertain days of the COVID lockdown that began in March 2020, U. S. commercial property markets actually embarked on a remarkable run, with some of the strongest returns, rent growth, and price appreciation rates ever recorded. Not every property type, however: hotels endured their worst and most sustained downturn in memory, while offices suffered an unprecedented and significant cut in usage of space. And not every market: some of the nations strongest gateway mar- kets, like New York City and San Francisco, experienced sharp outflows of residents, businesses, and tenants of all types. But overall and across much of the United States, property markets far outperformed expectations and historical norms. And now, more than two years on, property investors and managers are learning anew that whopping growth and profits eventually fall back to eartha reversion to the mean, to use finance jargon, or simply normalizing, as numerous industry experts we interviewed put it. Some looming market adjustments will be cyclical due to the weakening economic conditions that most economists and real estate professionals expect, while others represent more of a return to normalcy after all the pandemic-fueled market distortions. These market reversions will take several forms: prices of most assets are declining as cap rates rise and transaction volumes fall from record levels, while rent gains for others are merely moderating as demand returns to more sustainable levels. Perhaps the biggest surprise is that these reversals of fortune are hitting favored property sectors like multifamily and indus- trial. That does not necessarily mean the market corrections will be painful. In many cases, recent losses in property value will only trim already healthy gains. But many indicators suggest that the (really) good times may be over, at least for a while. Housing Set to Cool A finance executive with one national homebuilder told us, Were still selling. Its just not at the pace that it was selling before the last two years, which was a pace that you dont typi- cally see. So, the markets are more normalizing.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Deloitte 2023 Commercial Real Estate Outlook.pdf-!3: 3 Of course, those expectations came in the wake of a very challenging 2020. Furthermore, with revenue expectations muted, a greater proportion of respondents (33) are planning to cut costs compared to last year, when just 6 planned to make cuts. A RECENT DELOITTE ECONOMICS report offered several scenarios for the near-term outlook in the United States.2 The most likely scenario is that economic growth continues through 2022, though tightening monetary policy, peaking employment growth, and continued energy and food shortages slow this near-term growth trajectory. Inflation would remain high through 2022, but gradually settle around 2 by mid-2023 as demand for goods subsides in favor of services, helping businesses alleviate supply chain issues. The Federal Reserve would raise rates to combat inflation through 2022, but slow rate increases as inflation normalizes. Other, less likely scenarios include: (1) Back to the 1970s (25) where businesses raise prices and wages in lockstep and there is sustained high inflation. (2) COVID-19 relapse (5) in which vaccines become ineffective, and lockdowns are again imposed. And (3) Next recession (15), triggered by overly aggressive tightening of monetary policy as governments attempt to tame inflation. Regardless of which scenario comes to fruition, the 2023 Deloitte real estate outlook survey reveals that concerns about the economy are top of mind for most global real estate leaders as they prepare for the remainder of 2022 and 2023 . Revenue expectations for the full year are mixed among those surveyed, and generally more muted than last year. While 40 of 4 FIGURE 1 When asked to forecast 2022 revenues, respondents were much less optimistic than they were last year 2023 vs.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, property values behaved differently in the middle of 2022 compared to the beginning of the year.

Note: Bold type indicates the 20 highest-rated markets in Emerging Trends in Real Estate 2023 survey for overall real estate prospects. 73 Changes in Attitudes, Changes in Latitudes Befitting the changes in economic and market trends and outlooks that we have highlighted in this report, respondents to the Emerging Trends survey expressed substantial changes in market preferences. Many of the changes were relatively minor, and nine of the 10 highest-rated markets last year repeated this year . But there were some material changes over the year as about a quarter of markets moved up or down in rankings by at least 10 places. And consistent with our normal- izing trend, many of the markets near the top of the standings last year have fallen this year, while many previously lower- rate markets have risen: More than half (11) of the 20-highest rated markets in last years survey fell in the rankings this year, although almost all by less than 10 places. Meanwhile, some of the markets that were found lower in the rankings in prior years are now finding more support. Thirteen of the 20-lowest rated markets in last years survey rose in the rankings this year. Some Like It Hot Despite the modest drop in the Supernova ratings this year, Emerging Trends survey respondents still see the best prospects in Sun Belt metropolitan areas, which have been growing over time. The number of Sun Belt markets among the top 20 markets for overall prospects has increased from 10 in 2011 to 14 in each of the past two years. At the same time, the number of markets in cold-weather climates in the Northeast and Midwest has declined from five to just two . These climate preferences are even stronger at the top and bot- tom of the rankings.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!125: 3 2.6 2.4 3.3 2.7 3.0 2.9 1.6 2.2 2.7 2.4 2.3 2.9 2.4 2.0 1.9 2.2 2.0 1.8 2.0 2.3 2.1 2.1 2.1 1.5 1.8 2.1 previous two years, and only a scattering of others have placed over the past decade. Growth Attracts Its not heat and humidity that investors and developers seek in the Sun Belt markets, of course, but strong market prospects. And forecasts for population and especially economic growth show that are looking in the right places. Population and gross metro product (GMP) are both expected to grow far faster in the Magnet markets than just about anywhere else in the nation, particularly in the northern markets that constitute much of the Backbone markets. last four years to 1.6 percent over the next fivestill the highest of any subgroup but slower than before as these markets experi- ence some growing pains that we highlighted in our trends chapter. Also of note is that many of the Establishment markets that lost population during the pandemic are expected to reverse course and resume growth over the next few years. This growth will be slower than in our other market groups but represents the biggest increase from the recent past to the expected near term. This reversal perhaps accounts for the modest relative improve- ment in the 2023 ratings of the markets in this group. Accordingly, the Magnets have maintained their dominance at the top of the Emerging Trends ratings. Although their average ranking slipped slightly this year, more markets moved up than down. Growth is expected to be greatest in the Supernova subgroup but moderating from its recent torrid pace. For example, popula- tion growth is projected to slow from 1.9 percent annually over the Affordability Matters, Too Quality of life and affordability also matter.

The relative rankings of the markets tracked in Emerging Trends changed meaningfully this year as eco- nomic conditions in the United States appear to be heading for a slide. Nonetheless, many Magnet markets remain among the most favored, even if some of them have slipped a bit this year. At the same time, real estate professionals appear more willing to consider some markets that had been less in favor in recent years. The perpetual search for new opportunities ensures con- stant flux in how markets are viewed over time. Grouping the Markets After comprehensively reorganizing how we group our 80 geo- graphic markets two years ago and a lighter refresh last year, we are continuing with the same groupings this year and turn our focus to how the various groups and some key markets have changed since our previous report. Additional demo- graphic and economic data and more detailed descriptions of these market groups are available online, as listed at the end of this chapter. Magnets Magnet markets are migration destinations for both people and companies, and most are growing more quickly than the U. S. average in terms of both population and jobs. These metro areas are also the preferred markets for investors and builders, with the highest average Overall Real Estate Prospects ratings of any group in the Emerging Trends survey by a wide margin. Collectively, these markets account for almost one-third of the population base in the Emerging Trends coverage universe, the second-largest group in Markets to Watch. Super Sun Belt. These markets are large and diverse but still affordable, forming powerhouse economies that attract a wide range of businesses. Despite their large population bases, most are among the fastest-growing markets in the United States. Moreover, their economic performance has been solid through thick and thin. Though every market lost jobs during the pan- demic recession, recovery has been much quicker and more complete in the Super Sun Belt markets.

S. commercial property markets actually embarked on a remarkable run, with some of the strongest returns, rent growth, and price appreciation rates ever recorded. Not every property type, however: hotels endured their worst and most sustained downturn in memory, while offices suffered an unprecedented and significant cut in usage of space. And not every market: some of the nations strongest gateway mar- kets, like New York City and San Francisco, experienced sharp outflows of residents, businesses, and tenants of all types. But overall and across much of the United States, property markets far outperformed expectations and historical norms. And now, more than two years on, property investors and managers are learning anew that whopping growth and profits eventually fall back to eartha reversion to the mean, to use finance jargon, or simply normalizing, as numerous industry experts we interviewed put it. Some looming market adjustments will be cyclical due to the weakening economic conditions that most economists and real estate professionals expect, while others represent more of a return to normalcy after all the pandemic-fueled market distortions. These market reversions will take several forms: prices of most assets are declining as cap rates rise and transaction volumes fall from record levels, while rent gains for others are merely moderating as demand returns to more sustainable levels. Perhaps the biggest surprise is that these reversals of fortune are hitting favored property sectors like multifamily and indus- trial. That does not necessarily mean the market corrections will be painful. In many cases, recent losses in property value will only trim already healthy gains. But many indicators suggest that the (really) good times may be over, at least for a while. Housing Set to Cool A finance executive with one national homebuilder told us, Were still selling. Its just not at the pace that it was selling before the last two years, which was a pace that you dont typi- cally see. So, the markets are more normalizing.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!13:  More than half believe that capitalization rates are heading up next year and returns are coming down, primarily due to rising interest rates and cost of capital, which was the top economic concern voiced in our survey. After more than a decade of lower for longer, the Fed is finally normalizing interest rates closer to historical levels. Those rising interest rates are already driving up debt costs and thus the costs to acquire and develop property, reducing leveraged returns. At the same time, the federal government is done with providing stimulus, indirectly reducing tenant demand for space. Unlike in the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and during the pandemic, nobodys coming to the rescue, and now we got to take our medicine, and here it comes, says the head of research for an investment management firm. Thus, the government is turning off both the monetary and fiscal spigots that had been support- ing commercial real estate and the economy overall. The head of a development company summarized it like this: I feel like weve been on a little bit of a sugar high with this stimu- lus and cheap debt. Theres going to be a slowdown. Theres got to be this normalization. So, what does that mean? I think its going to be a little bouncy. Its going to be a little bit turbulent. But then we bottom out, and we start back into growth. 2.  Still, Weve Changed Some  The pandemic forced structural shifts in how and where we live, work, and recreate in ways that seem destinated to endure.  Online spending is receding from its pandemic peaks but is not likely to revert to pre-pandemic levels. Business travel is unlikely to recover to pre-COVID levels for at least several years, meaning business hotels, fine dining, and conference facilities will continue to face challenges.  The greatest changes may be in how and where we work. The impact on office use and leasing is still evolving, and a significant share of the existing stock may need to be reposi- tioned to remain competitive.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!18:  More firms are downsizing or not renewing their expiring leases, so vacancy rates are still slowly rising, in contrast to every other major property sector. Plus, tenants are dumping unused offices by trying to sublet the space until their leases expire. Brokers report that a record level of office space is available for sublease, and more is hitting the market every quarter. Much of this space will eventually turn into outright vacancies as leases turn, unless firms eventually reverse course. But no one we interviewed expects a mass departure from office buildings. Even under the most pessimistic scenarios, most knowledge work will occur in company offices, which, after all, were designed to facilitate this high-value work. But it will take more time for firms to figure out how much space they will need, how it should be configured, and where it should be located. As summarized by one economist, Mixing Greek mythology and biblical references, its probably really more of an Odyssey as opposed to an Exodus. The search for a post-pandemic new normal will continue. 3. Capital Moving to the Sidelinesor to Other Assets  After a robust first half of 2022, real estate property transac- tions began declining, primarily because buyers and sellers cannot agree on pricing due to heightened market uncer- tainty.  Rising debt costs and restrictive underwriting standards are also limiting transaction volumes.

In addition, we analyze how opportunistic and value-add managers will need to adopt their strategies now that interest rates are higher, and how their ability to generate out-size returns simply by adding leverage is gone. So, a number of important topics for us and investors to consider. We hope you find our answers insightful and useful in determining your strategy and thinking about some of the key questions in real estate as we move into the new year. Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy. Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs. We have already started to see cap rates and yields rise in many markets, with the most rapid adjustment taking place in the UK. However, we do not think that prices fully reflect higher interest rates yet. To assess when values might bottom out, we can look to past downturns and the listed market for guidance. In the Global Financial Crisis, for example, global capital values bottomed out in 4Q09, while GDP across global real estate markets troughed three quarters earlier, in 1Q09, as did global listed real estate prices1. Market downturns usually present opportunities, and one we expect for investors in 2023 is a correction in pricing as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. Although we do not expect large amounts of distress in the market, we do expect some, already apparent in parts of the UK market. This should allow investors access to assets at attractive pricing. The early 1990s downturn was longer, with US capital values continuing to decline into 1995. We expect modest declines in GDP in the first half of 2023 before growth resumes.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, cap rates and yields are now rising in many markets, not just limited to the UK, without fully reflecting higher interest rates yet .

Three, constrained construction of new supply, and a price run-up on the single-family for-sale front, spilled over into expanded apartment demand.  Lastly, compounding the effects of these four dramatic imbalances came the rocket fuel of a global capital rotation toward de-risked assets . Outsized demand, a sudden spike in remote work mobility, constricted supply, and floods of money with nowhere better to goa grand slam of anomalies. The U. S. apartment property sectorproviding shelter to 37 mil- lion residents in 21.3 million structures of five or more household units, and contributing $3.4 trillion annually to the U. S. economy, according to the NMHCmorphed quickly into an investment asset class pressure cooker. Inflated property valuations, com- pressed cap rates, and a sea change from individual owners to medium and large-sized corporate owners became a new norm seemingly overnight. This time period veers wildly from a steady slope of otherwise well-entrenched trends across the structural demand front. Operational modernization kicked into super-fast-forward mode toward self-service, and a robust new-development pipeline at least. According to a recent Bloomberg report, After dipping in 2020, the number of new units authorized in multifamily build- ings took off, running 37 percent higher over the past 12 months as of June 2022 than in the same period in 20182019. As of August, 862,000 apartments were under construction, up 25 percent from a year ago. At the same time, COVIDs aftermath sharply defined conflicting forceswhich together destine virtually all of Americas newly developed and built apartment communities for a financially privileged professional class. Rather than causing an expansion of rental housing stock, however, higher-income households come-lately demand for rental neighborhoods instead served to crowd out moderate- and lower-income households in supply- constrained areas. Its been virtually impossible to build affordable, says the chief executive of one of the apartment industry trade groups.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!11:  New home prices peaked in April 2022, while prices of existing homes likely peaked in June after appreciation started to slow with the rise in mortgage rates. Meanwhile, apartment rents have continued to push ever higher, but the pace has been moderating in recent months. Construction starts also have slowed. The National Association of Home Builders housing market index has fallen for eight straight months through August 2022 to its lowest level since May 2020. This is not to say that were in a housing recessionfar from it. Homes are still selling at a healthy rate by historical levels, and home prices remain near record levels. And while multifamily vacancies are at their lowest level in four decades and rents continue to log new records every month, the rates of increase have been slowing and are expected to decelerate further, according to many experts we interviewed. Maybe you dont see the 10 percentplus rent growth in multifamily markets, says the head of one institutional investment advisory firm. They should come back to more of a long-term historical average of 3 percent to 4 percent, and maybe offset some of the unafford- ability in the country. Indeed, housing markets may be partly victims of their own success as record prices and rents mean fewer households can afford to buy homes or rent apartments, particularly with mort- gage interest rates and housing-related expenses like utilities 6 rising sharplya topic we explore in Too Much for Too Many, our trend on housing affordability. The Amazon Pause The white-hot industrial market also seems set to cool after sev- eral years of unprecedented demand growth and rent gains that have pushed rents far above prior records. Growth in e-com- merce is slowing and giving back some of the market share it captured from physical retailers during the pandemic. Amazon, the largest warehouse user in the United States, has delayed occupying numerous completed projects, trying to sublet many, as it slows its physical growthwhat some are calling the Amazon pause. Other major retailers also have been cutting back their distribution expansion plans. To be sure, the industrial sector still enjoys record-low vacancy rates, as demand for high-quality, well-located logistics facilities has been running ahead of the markets ability to supply them.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!66:  Today, with more than one out of three of Americas 44 million renter households earning less than $36,000 a year, roughly every other rental household puts more than 30 percent of their earnings toward rent. And one out of every four households spends 50 percent or more of their wages on housing. Those percentages reflect divides that deepen because not enough new apartment units are coming online. A present that is polarized grows more so over time. For market- rate property investors, developers, owners, and managers, what lies ahead is the brightest beacon of prosperity. But for those who live and reside below the cutline of wherewithal and social mobility, the future of apartment rentals holds more ques- tions than answers. With 1.3 million new U. S. households projected each year through 2035, apartment industry trade groupsthe National Multifamily Housing Council (NMHC) and the National Apartment Associationcalculate that the United States needs 4.3 million newly built apartments between now and then. That level of new development would work out to 331,000 new multifamily rental units annually. This would expand the exist- ing apartment rental stock in the United States by more than 20 percent in just over a decade. What makes this goal plausible are two strong tailwinds: household demographics and an unprecedented global embrace of apartment development by the investment community. Still, the throes of land use policy drag on development. But beyond local policy barriers, tugging housing to its future, are a trio of macro forcesworklife balance, an urgency to stall the climate effects of global warming, and an array of technolo- giesin business management, livability, and construction. Can this darling of real estate asset classes sustain its hold on global investment inflows, unleash constructions modern manu- facturing era, turn the tide on local political will, and win over the hearts, minds, and pocketbooks of consumer households to pull off such a feat? If you had to guess todaywith residential rental vacancies at historical lows of 6.2 percent and occupancy rates and median asking rents for vacant units at historical highsthe answer would be a cautious yes.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Deloitte 2023 Commercial Real Estate Outlook.pdf-!7: 4 Note: Percentages may not add up to 100 due to rounding.

LOOKING AHEAD  The relentless math of higher interest rates will continue to weigh heavily on real estate values, at least until interest rates stabilize as inflation begins to subside. The bid- ask spread for private real estate should eventually close and transactions will resume in earnest at a rebased level.  In the meantime, investment styles that are less sensitive to volatility in values should be contemplated, such as floating-rate lending with a comfortable cushion from lower loan-to-value ratios. Debt investment can be attractive at times of uncertainty, as investors tilt toward contractually certain income and away from an uncertain upside. Portfolio aggregation strategies with smaller asset sizes that lend themselves to averaging-in with diversified timing of entry points represent another way to cope with volatile and uncertain values.  The inputs to the math are not changing to the same degree in every part of the world. Wherever rate spikes are less intense, or the prospects for rental growth are clearest, transaction activity and prices have been less impacted.  In addition to debt costs, investors should also consider the trajectory of cash flows, which depend on economic fundamentals and real estate occupier market conditions. The differential prospects for real estate cash flows are the subject of the next section.;\n\nreal_estate_index:global-real-estate-markets-2023.pdf-!1:  We also dive into student housing in the US, another sector booming among investors, and what impact demographic trends might have on it. In addition, we analyze how opportunistic and value-add managers will need to adopt their strategies now that interest rates are higher, and how their ability to generate out-size returns simply by adding leverage is gone. So, a number of important topics for us and investors to consider. We hope you find our answers insightful and useful in determining your strategy and thinking about some of the key questions in real estate as we move into the new year. Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy. Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs. We have already started to see cap rates and yields rise in many markets, with the most rapid adjustment taking place in the UK. However, we do not think that prices fully reflect higher interest rates yet. To assess when values might bottom out, we can look to past downturns and the listed market for guidance. In the Global Financial Crisis, for example, global capital values bottomed out in 4Q09, while GDP across global real estate markets troughed three quarters earlier, in 1Q09, as did global listed real estate prices1. Market downturns usually present opportunities, and one we expect for investors in 2023 is a correction in pricing as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. Although we do not expect large amounts of distress in the market, we do expect some, already apparent in parts of the UK market. This should allow investors access to assets at attractive pricing. The early 1990s downturn was longer, with US capital values continuing to decline into 1995. We expect modest declines in GDP in the first half of 2023 before growth resumes.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!16:  G LO BA L 2 The path of fundamentals will ultimately help determine where values settle Early in 2022, we framed the impact of rising inflation and interest rates on values as a race between debt costs and net operating income growth, as we anticipated that higher inflation would translate into higher rents in some sectors. Currently, it seems that debt costs are mostly winning the race. Ultimately, however, valuations are the result of the interaction between higher debt costs and the path of real estate fundamentals, the prospects for which vary widely across sectors and geographies. Tracing back real estate cash flows to their drivers is to follow a chain of causation back to basic variables like population, GDP, industrial production, consumer spending and employment. All of these interact with real estate factors, such as the balance of property supply and occupier demand, to influence property cash flows. Secular megatrends and structural features like legal and contractual constraints also matter. Going into 2023, there is increased uncertainty in many of these variables, especially the economic ones, given the pace of economic expansion is expected to be weaker or negative. This will have a cooling impact on property NOI growth, but nuances remain given that the transmission of macroeconomic conditions to real estate is a winding path. Starting with the underlying economic fundamentals, we are seeing a great deal of variation globally. In addition to the dimensions of depth and duration, a key uncertainty surrounding the coming downturn is how widespread it will be. Europe faces especially severe challenges stemming from an energy price shock, with ripple effects of unknown global scope. The dominant driver of inflation in the US, Canada and Singapore is that their economies are robust and operating close to full capacity. Demand- led inflation is relatively benign compared to inflation from a supply shock, but the central banks in these countries must still raise interest rates, either to manage their domestic economic situations or because their monetary policies are linked to the US Federal Reserve . Rising interest rates create clear risks to economic growth, with housing markets already being impacted by higher mortgage rates. Europes employment picture is also solid, but in addition to home-grown inflation, it is coping with a severe, energy-driven supply shock caused by the Russia-Ukraine war.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!11:   How severe an economic slowdown will be required to stabilize in inflation? Will the downturn be steep or shallow? Long or short in duration?  Longer term, will inflation become endemic, remaining sticky at a higher level than observed in recent decades? There are reasons for optimism. Labor markets across developed economies are in almost universally good health. Some of the initial triggers of this inflationary episode, such as supply chain pressures, seem to be resolving. Household and corporate balance sheets are reasonably healthy, although income statements are being hit by higher debt service costs wherever borrowing costs are not fixed. The typical culprit for a prolonged economic downturn is a balance sheet recession, as during the Global Financial Crisis, but the conditions for such a prolonged slump do not appear to be met in most segments of the global economy. Real estate fundamentals remain healthy and vacancy rates are low across many property sectors. Meanwhile, expectations for subdued long-run inflation remain in place, with long-run breakeven inflation rates implied by the market suggesting only a moderate increase from prior levels n o z i r o h r a e y - 0 1 r e v O ( 3.5 3.0 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 -0.;\n***\n[Submission]: No, the escalation in interest rates will not stop influencing property values as soon as deflation initiates.

Improvement in RevPAR is driving down delinquency rates, which, in turn, has decreased instances of distressed sales. 69 70 Markets to Watch Theres always a new bull market somewhere. Youve just got to go find it. Our report this year highlights two sometimes-contradictory property market trends: aspects of the industry are normaliz- ing or reverting closer to their pre-COVID patterns, while others appear to have sustained permanent shifts to a new normal as the pandemic induced changes in how and where we use differ- ent types of properties. These same patterns are playing out in how real estate professionals view prospects in the 80 markets tracked for this report. Reflecting the normalizing trend, almost every market in the country received lower ratings for both investment and develop- ment prospects this year, illustrating that outlooks are darkening just about everywhere following the brief post-COVID exuber- ance shown in last years survey across a variety of metrics. Similarly, some of the fastest-growing Sun Belt and other high- flying markets in recent years have faded a bit in the Emerging Trends standings, while many lower-rated markets are improving their relative status. On the other hand, the pandemic seems to have reinforced some trends, notably the dominance of what we called the Magnet marketsmany of which are in warmer Sun Belt regionsat the top of the Emerging Trends Markets to Watch standings, at the expense of the older and colder Exhibit 3-1 Warm versus Cold Climate Markets in Emerging Trends 20 Highest-Rated Markets, 20112023 Sun Belt markets Trendline Midwest and Northeast markets Trendline 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Source: Emerging Trends in Real Estate surveys.

The fate of shopping centers and physical retailers hangs on the answer, with downstream impacts on warehouses and logistics. The retail property sector fared far better during and since the pandemic than anyone could have expected, benefiting from both direct government assistance to retailers and the stimulus payments to households, who could keep spending, even if out of work. Business travel will continue to recover over time, but few expect levels to attain prior levels soon. The USTA study shows business travel flattening in 2023 short of pre-COVID levels. The greatest real estate impacts will be on business hotels, fine dining, and conference facilities. But office demand also could suffer as firms have less need to lease space to accommodate client visits. Those gains could moderate or even reverse if the online shopping share endures, however, as consumers shift some spending back from goods to nonretail services they avoided during the pandemic, like travel and entertainment. As one real estate investment trust (REIT) analyst notes, Theres still very healthy growth in e-commerce, but its no longer the lofty expec- tations we used to have at the height of the pandemic. With growth in online spending slowing, physical retailers will have an opportunity to regain some lost market share, espe- cially those that can bridge the gap between e-commerce and bricks and sticks. They survived very well in the pandemic and will probably continue to do well, says one investment con- sultant. Other winners will be the resourceful retailers that can provide consumers with compelling shopping experiences. But the permanent shift to greater online spending ultimately means that fewer shopping centers and retail space can survive. Business Travel versus Video Meetings The old Buggles song has it that Video Killed the Radio Star. And indeed, radio began to fade as television ascended in popularity. Now, in a different era, video meetings just might killor at least greatly reduceovernight business travel. According to the U. S. Travel Association (USTA), domestic business travel spending was 56 percent lower in 2021 than in 2019, while leisure travel was actually up modestly.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!8:  These conditions would be problematic for property markets: slowing or falling economic growth dampens tenant demand, while higher interest rates raise the cost of developing or acquiring properties. Both factors would cut returns and reduce values. Indeed, rising interest rates and uncertainty over future market conditions are already killing deals since sellers have not been ready to capitulate to buyers growing demands for price concessions, as we discuss in our capital markets trend. New Horizons Still, not all recessions are alike, and most economists, as well as Emerging Trends interviewees, expect any recession to be relatively short and shallow. Reflecting the view of several CRE leaders we interviewed, a senior executive with a global devel- opment and investment firm said, My gut says were going to have a recession, but its going to be relatively mild compared to some of the more severe recessions weve had. I dont see anything like the 2008 economic downturn going on. One leading CRE economist went so far as to say, I think were going into what I would say is a healthy down cycle. Its a cleansing, Schumpeterian idea that every so often, economies property markets includedneed to cleanse, and it washes out bad ideas, it washes out unrealistic unsustainable values. That reset presents new opportunities, even as it introduces uncertainty. Says the CEO of a development company, I think this is a moment in time. And when I look back historically, and I did not act in these moments in time, Ive always regretted it. The 10 emerging trends that we expect for 2023 and beyond follow: 1. Normalizing  Property market fundamentals are normalizing as some markets weaken due to diminishing pandemic tailwinds and the potential for a cyclical economic downturn. Exhibit 1-3 Importance of Issues for Real Estate in 2023 1 No importance 3 Moderate importance 5 Great importance  Some property sectors may cool, including residential and industrial, while others may heat up to historical average levels, such as hotels and retail.  Returns and prices of most assets are declining as cap rates rise and transaction volumes fall from record levels, while rent gains for others are merely moderating as demand returns to a more sustainable pace.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!105:  New Phase for Offices It may be a clich, but the pandemic exposed cracks and exac- erbated trends as much as started them. Dissatisfaction with offices did not start in 2020. Worker satisfaction was at an all- time low in 2019 because of factors such as densification, small workspaces, and mismanaged seating. Job one is to correct what was broken in the workplace, said the office consultant. We need to get the topic out of cocktail banter and into science of how to create the best outcomes. The key for office owners is to focus on facilitating the productiv- ity of tenants workforces by improving the health, safety, and functionality of buildings. I think we who are now in the real estate industry must realize we are no longer selling a product but selling a service, said one analyst. Those are different beasts. Any real estate investor that is not taking seriously the possibility that the market is being fundamentally upended is going to get a real shock. Office owners must understand the customer like never before. If not, they will have a problem. Retail It might be easy to assume that the consensus outlook for the retail sector in 2023 would be glum, given the outsized chal- lenges that retail has faced in recent years and with economic uncertainty on the horizon. But instead, there is a general sense of wary optimism, though not without considerable concern about the direction of the overall economy. A Shift from Structural to Cyclical Challenges Not surprisingly, when market participants were asked about the greatest challenges facing retail ahead, economic conditions garnered the most responses. Oversupply and e-commerce followed, but we should note that those issues consistently led survey responses in recent years. Obviously, we are all hyper- focused on the economy right now, one top real estate analyst told us. But for years, the biggest challenges to retail real estate have been deep structural ones related to e-commerce. The question now is whether the pandemic accelerated a lot of those changes, with much pain, and if we are past the worst of the disruptions. This shift in mind-set may be difficult to understand for those accustomed to the popular pre-pandemic narrative of retail apocalypse.;\n***\n[Submission]: No, it is not correct to conclude that the potential dominance of distressed sales in the US in 2023 is directly related to the ongoing constraints from the virus.

The willingness and ability to invest large amounts of money in maintaining health is therefore correspondingly strong. An ever increasing number of people worldwide al- so have access to medical care. Life Sciences essentially consist of a combination of various scientific disciplines such as biology, chemistry, medicine and pharmaceuticals. In turn, the main activity of the biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and medical technology segments in focus he- re is research into living organisms. Life Sciences are associated with the develop- ment of economically successful products for human health rather than with funda- mental research. In Germany, biotechnology moved centre stage and gained additi- onal momentum with the approval of the first Covid vaccine. However, the path to producing a market-ready substance is long and fraught with obstacles. Only a fraction of the substances researched are actually successful. To achieve rapid progress, sufficiently large teams are needed. Growth in the number of jobs in Life Sciences is leading to correspondingly higher demand for properties and investment. According to estimates, more than 300,000 people in more than 2,000 companies are employed in the Life Sciences sector in Germany. Biotechnology is the smallest segment, while pharmaceuticals and medical technology employ signifi- cantly more people. The functions of the properties required range from pure offices via laboratories and pharmaceutical logistics to production plants. From our perspec- tive, this combination of office and laboratory  the lab office  is of particular interest to investors.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!24:  0 2 2 r r p p A A 3 3 1 1 0 0 2 2 g g u u A A 3 3 1 1 0 0 2 2 c c e e D D 4 4 1 1 0 0 2 2 r r p p A A 4 4 1 1 0 0 2 2 g g u u A A 4 4 1 1 0 0 2 2 c c e e D D 1 1 5 5 0 0 2 2 r r p p A A 1 1 5 5 0 0 2 2 g g u u A A 1 1 5 5 0 0 2 2 c c e e D D 1 1 6 6 0 0 2 2 r r p p A A 1 1 6 6 0 0 2 2 g g u u A A 1 1 6 6 0 0 2 2 c c e e D D 7 7 1 1 0 0 2 2 r r p p A A 7 7 1 1 0 0 2 2 g g u u A A 7;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!12:  These locations benefit from their pro- ximity to universities, very good access to the skilled workers who are in short supp- ly, good transport links, and a comparatively plentiful supply of suitable space. The cluster formation helps to mitigate the risks associated with real estate develop- ments, because it is easier to find a new tenant for a property. The reuse of a proper- ty is potentially more difficult outside the Life Science clusters. Requirements for property, labs and space vary. Start-ups need only a few hundred square metres of space, consisting essentially of labs for research and development. More space is generally required for further growth and the necessary clinical testing phases, with an increasing proportion of office usage. Given favourable economic prospects and associated expansion, management functions will become more im- portant, and demand for office space in particular will increase. Lab requirements also differ. Analysis by JLL differentiates between wet and dry labs, and biological and chemical wet labs. The requirements for a dry lab are fairly moderate, for example similar to utility rooms. The costs are therefore only slightly higher than for office space. The requirements for wet labs are considerably higher because they involve the use of chemicals and special analytical equipment. These include, for example, higher ceilings, special surfaces, and powerful extraction and ventilation systems for gases and liquids. The costs of construction, interior fittings and ongoing operations can be significantly higher than for classic office space here.

In simplified terms, this is the motivation driving the booming Life Sciences sector of the economy, which is resear- ching corresponding solutions. However, classic office premises are not appropriate for companies in this segment. Although office space is required for administrative and management functions, the main focus is on laboratory space used by the biolo- gists, chemists and medical staff who are carrying out the research. This combinati- on - the young lab offices segment - is of increasing interest to investors. What lies behind the lab office trend and what potential does it have? The Covid pandemic is a starting point for a review of this segment. It has not only shifted vaccine development into the public focus, but has also brought into the mainstream concepts such as vulnerable and pre-existing conditions to refer to people at risk of serious cases of Covid 19. Because people are living longer thanks to medical progress, these concepts apply to large sections of the population and not just to a small number of people. In 2021 in Germany more than one fifth of the po- pulation  around 18 million people  had reached the age of 65. However, increa- sed life expectancy has not so far been accompanied by improved fitness levels. In fact the opposite is true. A sedentary lifestyle, high-calorie food, ready meals contai- ning a lot of sugar, and the consumption of alcohol and tobacco have consequences, and considerably increase the risk of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, demen- tia, heart attacks, cancer and strokes. The growing number of older people suffering ill health is also a significant economic factor.;\n***\n[Submission]: Answer: DNA is the genetic material of a cell and is responsible for the transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next.

Little Consensus beyond Hybrid The future of work is hybrid. Surveys indicate that the average office employee will work in person three to 3.5 days a week, reflecting the tug-of-war between employers and employees.

Pro-office voices are growing and companies particularly in the financial sectorare increasingly demanding a full-time return to the office. Employees, however, are happy to avoid time-consuming, expensive, and stressful commutes and to have flexibility to make daily schedules that permit a worklife balance. Flexible work schedules allow for more housing options, since commuting fewer days per week allows workers to choose housing further from the officea significant benefit when housing costs have hit record levels. The taste of freedom gained during the pandemic will be difficult to take away. Firms, including Apple, that have tried to implement stricter in-office policies are getting pushback.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Deloitte 2023 Commercial Real Estate Outlook.pdf-!22:  Australian software company Atlassian has created a Team Anywhere policy that allows their 8,000 staff to work from any location in a country in which Atlassian is based.65 The company only requires office attendance four times a year, but staff have still indicated they expect to be in the office half of the time. This policy has led to a boost in morale: nearly 300 employees have relocated, citing moving closer to family, seeing the world, and international opportunities as primary benefits.66 A new workforce population has emerged since the pandemic: Super commuters. These are people who permanently relocated during COVID-19 quarantines in search of space or to be closer to loved ones. Many believed they would continue to work from home, but now, some employers want them back in the office, at least with some semiregularity. So, these super commuters willingly commute at least 90 minutes in one direction, as theyve become locked into their new locations due to affordability or lifestyle preferences.67 RECOMMENDATIONS  Empower people at all levels, regardless of seniority and job function. Employees increasingly want to know how their work contributes to company goals. Reverse-mentoring initiatives are a good way to incorporate the opinions of more junior members alongside senior leaders. Firms should provide opportunities for career development and upskilling by supplementing daily responsibilities with projects outside of employees normal scopes.  Foster inclusivity with those who work remotely. Take steps to ensure everyone has equal opportunities to form connections, especially so that those who spend less time in the office dont feel punished. Strategies include intentional in-person meetings, hybrid working team training sessions, equitable promotion rates for remote workers, and encouraging manager one-on-ones.68 23 Embracing technology for greater efficiency and new opportunities SOME SURVEY RESPONDENTS foresee a reduction in technology budgets in the near term, given overall economic concerns, including inflation, labor costs, and ongoing supply chain uncertainties.

City living might not be everyones ideal, but it has come back into favor for part of the population. Meanwhile in Asia, home to dense cities that integrate live, work and play into mixed-use settings, it never really fell out of favor. Perhaps the most important observation about the balance of in-person and virtual interaction today is that it appears to have reached a steady state, at least for now. Dining out seems to be stable at a high level. Office usage indicators like workplace mobility and keycard entries, however, are stuck at a more moderate, if globally variable, level. They had been characterized by a broad trend of gradual improvement interrupted by variant- related setbacks, but leveled off as of mid-2022, as shown in Exhibit G.7. Given that COVID-related restrictions are mostly gone, further normalization in the balance of in-person and virtual modalities will have to rely on changes in company policy and the possible influence of a recession on workplace culture. Exceptions include international travel in Asia Pacific and cross-border migration, which still have robust intrinsic recovery potential.  Further large changes in the balance  While the balance of in-person and virtual LOOKING AHEAD between in-person and virtual interaction are probably unlikely. This does not preclude any cyclical changes to discretionary spending that respond to the economic situation, such as a potential reduction in travel and going out because of squeezed real incomes.  It is probably wishful thinking to expect further large gains in office attendance anywhere in the world. This is most significant for the US, where office use is lowest. That said, a weakening of the labor market could tip the balance of power away from employees as employers mandate a return. modalities may have reached something close to a steady state, occupiers are in the early days of reconfiguring workplaces to match the new living with COVID world.

The lagged impact from tighter financial conditions appears to finally be feeding through, with preliminary signs that inflation is cooling. But many uncertainties remain.  Higher borrowing costs have flipped the impact of debt to negative on a leveraged cash yield basis, but solid NOI growth prospects in some sectors mean that debt continues to be accretive to holding-period IRRs in many cases. Reduced asset values are most evident in the logistics, multi-family and niche sectors, property types for which continued transaction activity provides pricing evidence.  The outlook for the US and Canadian office sectors is uniquely weak in the global context. In-person office attendance remains substantially below that of other regions, with limited prospects for near-term improvement.;\n\nreal_estate_index:bouwinvest_international-market-outlook_2023-2025-1.pdf-!10:  Prime office values at East and West Coast locations dropped by over 5 in H1 2022 and we expect this trend to continue in the second half of the year with a further decline of roughly 10-15. Sustainability is not completely top of mind on the U. S. political agenda which is focused more on social inclusion. The corporate and international investor community is, however, acknowledging the need for more sustainable buildings. Individual cities rather than the national government are leading the U. S. on this topic. Prime offices in the sunbelt cities appear to be better positioned due to migration patterns and rising employment and the drop in values is expected to be confined to around 5 over 2022. During the outlook period we expect East and West Coast office values to shed roughly an additional 10 while pricing in the Sunbelt cities and Miami will, for the most part, remain relatively steady. Yields are expected to move out by around 30bps over the outlook period. Bouwinvest Outlook 2023-2025 17 North America Logistics Retail The sector continues to be buoyed by fundamental demand drivers such as e-commerce, supply chain reconfiguration and government (infrastructure) investment programmes. Rental growth is therefore expected to remain positive during the outlook period, rising approximately 3 on average per annum during 2023-2025. The shopping centre market in North America was hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic which accelerated the already visible negative trend. A partial recovery took place in 2022, but the outlook period is expected to be challenging due to high inflation, low consumer confidence and a weaker economic outlook. The growth of e-commerce is expected to slow, however, due to the fading pandemic and an expected economic recession. We expect the volume of new leasing transactions to be more sluggish than in the exceptionally strong years of 2020 and 2021. E-commerce giant Amazon, the largest corporate user of logistics space in the U. S. has indicated that it will sublease a significant part (10) of its warehouse space.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Deloitte 2023 Commercial Real Estate Outlook.pdf-!3: 3 Of course, those expectations came in the wake of a very challenging 2020. Furthermore, with revenue expectations muted, a greater proportion of respondents (33) are planning to cut costs compared to last year, when just 6 planned to make cuts. A RECENT DELOITTE ECONOMICS report offered several scenarios for the near-term outlook in the United States.2 The most likely scenario is that economic growth continues through 2022, though tightening monetary policy, peaking employment growth, and continued energy and food shortages slow this near-term growth trajectory. Inflation would remain high through 2022, but gradually settle around 2 by mid-2023 as demand for goods subsides in favor of services, helping businesses alleviate supply chain issues. The Federal Reserve would raise rates to combat inflation through 2022, but slow rate increases as inflation normalizes. Other, less likely scenarios include: (1) Back to the 1970s (25) where businesses raise prices and wages in lockstep and there is sustained high inflation. (2) COVID-19 relapse (5) in which vaccines become ineffective, and lockdowns are again imposed. And (3) Next recession (15), triggered by overly aggressive tightening of monetary policy as governments attempt to tame inflation. Regardless of which scenario comes to fruition, the 2023 Deloitte real estate outlook survey reveals that concerns about the economy are top of mind for most global real estate leaders as they prepare for the remainder of 2022 and 2023 . Revenue expectations for the full year are mixed among those surveyed, and generally more muted than last year. While 40 of 4 FIGURE 1 When asked to forecast 2022 revenues, respondents were much less optimistic than they were last year 2023 vs.;\n\nreal_estate_index:bouwinvest_international-market-outlook_2023-2025-1.pdf-!5:  Broker reports indicate that prime yields already started to move out in some locations between Q1 2022 and Q2 2022, with German cities leading the pack at 30bps. French and Spanish cities posted quarter-on-quarter yield increases of between 15 and 25bps. As risk-free rates are up and expected to remain elevated between 2023 and 2025, we believe office capital values could soften further during the outlook period, and we estimate prime yields in Europe will move out by another 50bps. This would amount to a value loss of around 10 to 15 before stabilization and recovery takes place. Office transaction volumes in Europe already fell by over 20 during Q2 2022 compared with the same year-earlier period. Bouwinvest Outlook 2023-2025 9 Europe Logistics Covid-19 had a surprisingly positive effect on European logistics markets with the accelerated adoption of online shopping more than offsetting the economic turmoil. Now that the pandemic appears to be largely under control, the pace of e-commerce growth has eased, but is still positive and the potential for further expansion remains strong as consumers service expectations continue to evolve and drive demand for logistics properties. reluctance among municipalities to issue land for new logistic space. We expect this latter trend to continue in the coming years, with Germany and France currently showing the most resistance to new greenfield developments. As a result, nominal rental growth, although slowing down, is expected to remain positive during the outlook period at a figure just shy of 3.0 per annum. Global supply chain disruption following the pandemic and ongoing geopolitical tensions are also fuelling a supply chain reconfiguration with a greater emphasis on onshoring over just-in-time. This is boosting domestic demand for logistics real estate and helping to ease wider supply chain pressures. European economic support programmes running until 2027 and totalling 1.1 trillion are expected to provide another boost to the sector. The volume of new supply coming to market is meanwhile decreasing due to both rising construction costs and a Capital values of prime logistics properties are forecast to decline by an average 7-8 in Q4 2022 compared with Q4 2021 levels.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, there is an estimated value loss during the outlook period.

This is reflected in consumer sentiment which has fallen to a historic low. The GfK survey shows that income expectations have slumped to an even greater degree than the propensity to buy. This is bad news for city centre retail in two respects, with the need to make savings driving consumer spending down further. Nominal wages are rising comparatively strongly in 2022, however the growth is being more than offset by high inflation, probably of an annual average rate close to 8 per cent. Below the line, spending power is falling significantly, much more steeply than in the last three decades. While low inflation has supported retail activity since 2012 in the form of real wage growth, the opposite is now the case. Busy shopping centres and restaurants convey a different picture. However, house- holds are reluctant to spend. The German Federal Statistical Office reported an infla- tion-adjusted decline of 9 per cent in retail sales in June 2022 compared to the same month last year. Consequently, nominal and real retail sales diverged sharply at mid- year. The music sector is another example. Tickets for some concerts are selling so slowly that tours have already been cancelled.

Large numbers of refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine have ar- rived in Germany and they could to be joined by many urgently needed skilled work- ers in future, pointing to a fresh acceleration in rents. However, it remains to be seen whether this actually happens. Households are being hit hard by high inflation and especially by the rise in energy prices. The latter is also affecting the economy which teeters on the brink of a recession, which in turn could dampen the labour market and hence household incomes. Rent regulation also suggests that sharp rent increases are unlikely, at least in the case of flats covered by the rent cap. The reason for this is the that Mietspiegel review period  already extended from four to six years and which the government plans to extend to seven years  has dampened the normal local comparable rent as a basis for rent rises.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2023_Housing_market_outlook__Price_dip_and_interes.pdf-!25:  com as of February 20, 2023 Sources: Deutsche Bank Research, Numbeo Doo 7 April 21, 2023 Germany Monitor 13 14 2023 Housing market outlook 1970-2022 Price-to-rent percentiles based on OECD countries 15 dimensionless 70 74 78 82 86 90 94 98 02 06 10 14 18 22 20-percentile Median Germany 80-percentile Sources: Deutsche Bank Research, OECD 2022-2024 Migration per months from Ukraine 16 Sources: Deutsche Bank Research, Federal Statistical Office 23 24 2022-2024 Migration from Ukraine cumulated 17 0 22 Sources: Deutsche Bank Research, Federal Statistical Office 23 24 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 in '000 500 400 300 200 100 0 22 in '000 1600 1200 800 400 2.3 Affordability indices fall In the following, we compare Germany's price-to-income ratio with that of 21 other OECD countries from 1980 to 2022.

LOOKING AHEAD  The relentless math of higher interest rates will continue to weigh heavily on real estate values, at least until interest rates stabilize as inflation begins to subside. The bid- ask spread for private real estate should eventually close and transactions will resume in earnest at a rebased level.  In the meantime, investment styles that are less sensitive to volatility in values should be contemplated, such as floating-rate lending with a comfortable cushion from lower loan-to-value ratios. Debt investment can be attractive at times of uncertainty, as investors tilt toward contractually certain income and away from an uncertain upside. Portfolio aggregation strategies with smaller asset sizes that lend themselves to averaging-in with diversified timing of entry points represent another way to cope with volatile and uncertain values.  The inputs to the math are not changing to the same degree in every part of the world. Wherever rate spikes are less intense, or the prospects for rental growth are clearest, transaction activity and prices have been less impacted.  In addition to debt costs, investors should also consider the trajectory of cash flows, which depend on economic fundamentals and real estate occupier market conditions. The differential prospects for real estate cash flows are the subject of the next section.;\n\nreal_estate_index:global-real-estate-markets-2023.pdf-!1:  We also dive into student housing in the US, another sector booming among investors, and what impact demographic trends might have on it. In addition, we analyze how opportunistic and value-add managers will need to adopt their strategies now that interest rates are higher, and how their ability to generate out-size returns simply by adding leverage is gone. So, a number of important topics for us and investors to consider. We hope you find our answers insightful and useful in determining your strategy and thinking about some of the key questions in real estate as we move into the new year. Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy. Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs. We have already started to see cap rates and yields rise in many markets, with the most rapid adjustment taking place in the UK. However, we do not think that prices fully reflect higher interest rates yet. To assess when values might bottom out, we can look to past downturns and the listed market for guidance. In the Global Financial Crisis, for example, global capital values bottomed out in 4Q09, while GDP across global real estate markets troughed three quarters earlier, in 1Q09, as did global listed real estate prices1. Market downturns usually present opportunities, and one we expect for investors in 2023 is a correction in pricing as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. Although we do not expect large amounts of distress in the market, we do expect some, already apparent in parts of the UK market. This should allow investors access to assets at attractive pricing. The early 1990s downturn was longer, with US capital values continuing to decline into 1995. We expect modest declines in GDP in the first half of 2023 before growth resumes.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!59:  1 2 - c e D 2 2 - n a J 2 2 - b e F 2 2 - r a M 2 2 - r p A 2 2 - y a M 2 2 - n u J 2 2 - u J l 2 2 - g u A 2 2 - p e S 2 2 - t c O 2 2 - v o N Date of forecast GDP Forecast for: US 2023 Canada 2023 US 2024 Canada 2024 Source: Oxford Economics, as of November 16, 2022. around long-term interest rates and pricing than around near-term economic growth and real estate fundamentals. We are reluctant to make investment decisions based solely on a view of future interest rates, but acknowledge that real estate pricing is linked to future interest rates. Given this dynamic, we recommend investors consider a range of interest rate scenarios . Interest rate increases and the relentless math Each time interest rates ticked higher since the GFC, the question of when higher debt costs would impact real estate values was asked. It was a speculative question, with the underlying assumption that rate increases thus far had not yet impacted values. Regardless of the answer then, it became very clear in 2022 that the relentless math of higher borrowing rates was having an impact on leveraged returns and asset values . The boost investors were getting from borrowing has shifted to a drag on a cash basis, but with unleveraged internal rates of return generally above borrowing rates, leverage is still marginally accretive on a total return basis. However, with less lift from borrowing, leveraged buyers are largely out of the market . Higher borrowing rates are a function of both higher indices and increased borrowing spreads. Lending volume is down significantly and lenders are becoming more conservative. The supply of debt capital from large money center banks is down due to large positions taken in the first half of 2022 coupled with stress testing. The Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (CMBS) market continues to be impacted by volatility and life companies are looking into 2023 until fresh allocations become available.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!16:  G LO BA L 2 The path of fundamentals will ultimately help determine where values settle Early in 2022, we framed the impact of rising inflation and interest rates on values as a race between debt costs and net operating income growth, as we anticipated that higher inflation would translate into higher rents in some sectors. Currently, it seems that debt costs are mostly winning the race. Ultimately, however, valuations are the result of the interaction between higher debt costs and the path of real estate fundamentals, the prospects for which vary widely across sectors and geographies. Tracing back real estate cash flows to their drivers is to follow a chain of causation back to basic variables like population, GDP, industrial production, consumer spending and employment. All of these interact with real estate factors, such as the balance of property supply and occupier demand, to influence property cash flows. Secular megatrends and structural features like legal and contractual constraints also matter. Going into 2023, there is increased uncertainty in many of these variables, especially the economic ones, given the pace of economic expansion is expected to be weaker or negative. This will have a cooling impact on property NOI growth, but nuances remain given that the transmission of macroeconomic conditions to real estate is a winding path. Starting with the underlying economic fundamentals, we are seeing a great deal of variation globally. In addition to the dimensions of depth and duration, a key uncertainty surrounding the coming downturn is how widespread it will be. Europe faces especially severe challenges stemming from an energy price shock, with ripple effects of unknown global scope. The dominant driver of inflation in the US, Canada and Singapore is that their economies are robust and operating close to full capacity. Demand- led inflation is relatively benign compared to inflation from a supply shock, but the central banks in these countries must still raise interest rates, either to manage their domestic economic situations or because their monetary policies are linked to the US Federal Reserve . Rising interest rates create clear risks to economic growth, with housing markets already being impacted by higher mortgage rates. Europes employment picture is also solid, but in addition to home-grown inflation, it is coping with a severe, energy-driven supply shock caused by the Russia-Ukraine war.;\n***\n[Submission]: Answer: Yes, interest rates are expected to continue rising indefinitely, impacting real estate values.

S. commercial property markets actually embarked on a remarkable run, with some of the strongest returns, rent growth, and price appreciation rates ever recorded. Not every property type, however: hotels endured their worst and most sustained downturn in memory, while offices suffered an unprecedented and significant cut in usage of space. And not every market: some of the nations strongest gateway mar- kets, like New York City and San Francisco, experienced sharp outflows of residents, businesses, and tenants of all types. But overall and across much of the United States, property markets far outperformed expectations and historical norms. And now, more than two years on, property investors and managers are learning anew that whopping growth and profits eventually fall back to eartha reversion to the mean, to use finance jargon, or simply normalizing, as numerous industry experts we interviewed put it. Some looming market adjustments will be cyclical due to the weakening economic conditions that most economists and real estate professionals expect, while others represent more of a return to normalcy after all the pandemic-fueled market distortions. These market reversions will take several forms: prices of most assets are declining as cap rates rise and transaction volumes fall from record levels, while rent gains for others are merely moderating as demand returns to more sustainable levels. Perhaps the biggest surprise is that these reversals of fortune are hitting favored property sectors like multifamily and indus- trial. That does not necessarily mean the market corrections will be painful. In many cases, recent losses in property value will only trim already healthy gains. But many indicators suggest that the (really) good times may be over, at least for a while. Housing Set to Cool A finance executive with one national homebuilder told us, Were still selling. Its just not at the pace that it was selling before the last two years, which was a pace that you dont typi- cally see. So, the markets are more normalizing.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!13:  More than half believe that capitalization rates are heading up next year and returns are coming down, primarily due to rising interest rates and cost of capital, which was the top economic concern voiced in our survey. After more than a decade of lower for longer, the Fed is finally normalizing interest rates closer to historical levels. Those rising interest rates are already driving up debt costs and thus the costs to acquire and develop property, reducing leveraged returns. At the same time, the federal government is done with providing stimulus, indirectly reducing tenant demand for space. Unlike in the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and during the pandemic, nobodys coming to the rescue, and now we got to take our medicine, and here it comes, says the head of research for an investment management firm. Thus, the government is turning off both the monetary and fiscal spigots that had been support- ing commercial real estate and the economy overall. The head of a development company summarized it like this: I feel like weve been on a little bit of a sugar high with this stimu- lus and cheap debt. Theres going to be a slowdown. Theres got to be this normalization. So, what does that mean? I think its going to be a little bouncy. Its going to be a little bit turbulent. But then we bottom out, and we start back into growth. 2.  Still, Weve Changed Some  The pandemic forced structural shifts in how and where we live, work, and recreate in ways that seem destinated to endure.  Online spending is receding from its pandemic peaks but is not likely to revert to pre-pandemic levels. Business travel is unlikely to recover to pre-COVID levels for at least several years, meaning business hotels, fine dining, and conference facilities will continue to face challenges.  The greatest changes may be in how and where we work. The impact on office use and leasing is still evolving, and a significant share of the existing stock may need to be reposi- tioned to remain competitive.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!14:  Even as property markets begin to normalize in many ways after some of the disruptions of the past few years, we wont be resum- ing our former lives in some key respects. The pandemic forced structural shifts in how and where we live, work, and recreate in ways that seem destinated to endure at least at some level, even if less extreme than our behaviors during the peak of COVID. Many activities have already returned to pre-pandemic levels, of course, especially those involving socializing. Americans are back to attending concerts and sporting events, and leisure travelers, at least, have returned to the nations roads and airways. Meanwhile, we are obviously tired of exercising and cooking alone at home, so gym memberships have returned to historical levels while restaurant sales are back above grocer- ies, as they had been since 2015 until COVID shut down dining establishments. Yet many other activitiesand how we use spaceseem unlikely to return to the old ways. The pandemic changed us. Says a director of an investment management firm, People are looking to achieve their lifestyle choices more quickly. Theyre less focused on their employer and more focused on their per- sonal lifestyle. And that is changing how apartments are being viewed, how single-family residential is being viewed, how office is being utilized, and where corporations are heading. In-Store versus Online Shopping Much of our spending shifted online during the pandemic. The e-commerce share of retail sales shot up from 13 percent in 2019 to a peak of 20 percent during the initial national lockdown. That drained a lot of spending from physical retailers and squeezed the nations shopping centers. The online share inevitably waned as the economy reopened and more consumers felt comfortable shopping in stores again. But dont expect online spending to drop down to pre-pandemic levels, say many experts we interviewed. While shoppers initially resorted to e-commerce due to safety concerns or simply because the stores were not even opendid we really live through that?they still shop online today because of its other benefits, including greater convenience, selection, and price advantages. Thus, the share we spend online remains highly elevated at just under 18 percent, nearly five percentage points above the rate before COVID.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!105:  New Phase for Offices It may be a clich, but the pandemic exposed cracks and exac- erbated trends as much as started them. Dissatisfaction with offices did not start in 2020. Worker satisfaction was at an all- time low in 2019 because of factors such as densification, small workspaces, and mismanaged seating. Job one is to correct what was broken in the workplace, said the office consultant. We need to get the topic out of cocktail banter and into science of how to create the best outcomes. The key for office owners is to focus on facilitating the productiv- ity of tenants workforces by improving the health, safety, and functionality of buildings. I think we who are now in the real estate industry must realize we are no longer selling a product but selling a service, said one analyst. Those are different beasts. Any real estate investor that is not taking seriously the possibility that the market is being fundamentally upended is going to get a real shock. Office owners must understand the customer like never before. If not, they will have a problem. Retail It might be easy to assume that the consensus outlook for the retail sector in 2023 would be glum, given the outsized chal- lenges that retail has faced in recent years and with economic uncertainty on the horizon. But instead, there is a general sense of wary optimism, though not without considerable concern about the direction of the overall economy. A Shift from Structural to Cyclical Challenges Not surprisingly, when market participants were asked about the greatest challenges facing retail ahead, economic conditions garnered the most responses. Oversupply and e-commerce followed, but we should note that those issues consistently led survey responses in recent years. Obviously, we are all hyper- focused on the economy right now, one top real estate analyst told us. But for years, the biggest challenges to retail real estate have been deep structural ones related to e-commerce. The question now is whether the pandemic accelerated a lot of those changes, with much pain, and if we are past the worst of the disruptions. This shift in mind-set may be difficult to understand for those accustomed to the popular pre-pandemic narrative of retail apocalypse.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, industry professionals perceive a reversion or recalibration back to the usual state of the property market post-COVID lockdown.

Nonetheless, the glow for this category has faded somewhat as their unfettered growth has invited some big-city problems like congestion and rising living costs. Last years shooting star, Boise, fell sharply after two years in the top 20. Raleigh has continued its modest decline, from the top-rated market in 2021 to number six in the 2023 survey. But more broadly, the Supernovas appear to be suffering some growing pains, as discussed elsewhere in this report. Housing construction is not keeping pace with household growth, strain- ing housing affordability, which has been one of the chief attractions. The Establishment The Establishment markets have long been the nations eco- nomic engines. The 20 markets in this category produce almost 43 percent of the GMP in the 80 Emerging Trends markets while accounting for only 34 percent of its population base. This pri- marily reflects the outsized contributions of the nations gateway markets, which we refer to as the Knowledge and Innovation Centers. Though growing more slowly than the Magnet markets, the Establishment markets still offer tremendous opportunities. This groups average rating is second among our four major group- ings. However, the appeal of these markets to investors and developers has waned in recent years as growth has slowed across many of these markets while challenges have increased. Multitalented Producers. Though all the Establishment markets are large and economically varied, some are more diverse than others, specifically the multitalented metro areas of Chicago, Los Angeles, San Jose, and Seattle. Workers here tend to be productive, with per capita GMP ranking the second highest of any of the subgroups. Though their elevated cost of doing business and getting deals done limits their appeal for some real estate professionals, the Multitalented Producers Exhibit 3-8 U.

Many of the changes were relatively minor, and nine of the 10 highest-rated markets last year repeated this year . But there were some material changes over the year as about a quarter of markets moved up or down in rankings by at least 10 places. And consistent with our normal- izing trend, many of the markets near the top of the standings last year have fallen this year, while many previously lower- rate markets have risen: More than half (11) of the 20-highest rated markets in last years survey fell in the rankings this year, although almost all by less than 10 places. Meanwhile, some of the markets that were found lower in the rankings in prior years are now finding more support. Thirteen of the 20-lowest rated markets in last years survey rose in the rankings this year. Some Like It Hot Despite the modest drop in the Supernova ratings this year, Emerging Trends survey respondents still see the best prospects in Sun Belt metropolitan areas, which have been growing over time. The number of Sun Belt markets among the top 20 markets for overall prospects has increased from 10 in 2011 to 14 in each of the past two years. At the same time, the number of markets in cold-weather climates in the Northeast and Midwest has declined from five to just two . These climate preferences are even stronger at the top and bot- tom of the rankings.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!128:  average, where U. S. 100.0.

The relative rankings of the markets tracked in Emerging Trends changed meaningfully this year as eco- nomic conditions in the United States appear to be heading for a slide. Nonetheless, many Magnet markets remain among the most favored, even if some of them have slipped a bit this year. At the same time, real estate professionals appear more willing to consider some markets that had been less in favor in recent years. The perpetual search for new opportunities ensures con- stant flux in how markets are viewed over time. Grouping the Markets After comprehensively reorganizing how we group our 80 geo- graphic markets two years ago and a lighter refresh last year, we are continuing with the same groupings this year and turn our focus to how the various groups and some key markets have changed since our previous report. Additional demo- graphic and economic data and more detailed descriptions of these market groups are available online, as listed at the end of this chapter. Magnets Magnet markets are migration destinations for both people and companies, and most are growing more quickly than the U. S. average in terms of both population and jobs. These metro areas are also the preferred markets for investors and builders, with the highest average Overall Real Estate Prospects ratings of any group in the Emerging Trends survey by a wide margin. Collectively, these markets account for almost one-third of the population base in the Emerging Trends coverage universe, the second-largest group in Markets to Watch. Super Sun Belt. These markets are large and diverse but still affordable, forming powerhouse economies that attract a wide range of businesses. Despite their large population bases, most are among the fastest-growing markets in the United States. Moreover, their economic performance has been solid through thick and thin. Though every market lost jobs during the pan- demic recession, recovery has been much quicker and more complete in the Super Sun Belt markets. These metro areas collectively have the highest average rating of any subgroup, as it did last year. 18-Hour Cities.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!135:  Significantly, all maintained positive population growth through the pandemic. Though population growth is expected to moder- ate in some of these markets, the overall ratings for this group rose strongly in this years survey. Exhibit 3-11 U. S.

Reinventing markets are eastern and midwestern cities seeking to modernize their economic base. Many were manufacturing centers and are now moving to a more sustain- able mix of education, health care, and technology. Though the economic rebound in most of these markets lags the national recovery, the federal governments stimulus programs have helped cushion the downturn. However, anemic popula- tion growth remains a problem. Overall, there was no material change in the outlook for these markets, in the view of Emerging Trends respondents, but Detroit showed a substantial improve- ment this year, continuing the gains first seen in Emerging Trends 2021.

As the former homebuilder we quoted earlier puts it, what is needed is a new way of getting housing out there and get it built more affordably. 15 5. Give Me Quality, Give Me Niche Investment demand for commercial real estate assets is still healthy, if more tentative, as discussed in Capital Moving to the Sidelinesor to Other Assets. But real estate capital markets are also becoming more bifurcated between the favored and the scorned as investors, lenders, and developers turn more selective than they have been in recent years. What assets will find love and capitalin the coming years? Investors and developers seem to be preferring three distinct types of opportunities:  The security of major product types with the strongest demand fundamentals, notably industrial and multifamily housing, which essentially tie for top investment ratings in this years Emerging Trends survey.  Best-quality assets in sectors undergoing significant demand disruption, especially retail and office. And  Narrowly targeted subsectors and newer niche asset types . There is much less appetite now for riskier opportunistic invest- ments. Our survey also confirms continuing strong interest in Sun Belt markets, though the rankings are moderately tighter than last year, as we show in our markets review in chapter 3. Hot or Not? The dominant capital market trend is the increasing divergence of demand among different property types and then within property types, particularly office. As investors get more selective, they increasingly choose safer sectors with the most compelling market fundamentals. Tenant demand continues to outpace the markets capacity to add new supply in both the residential and industrial sectors, which therefore draw the greatest interest from capital markets. Retail and office, by contrast, find much less support. We repeatedly heard some version of that story in interviews with industry leaders. But that big picture does not fully capture the range of market currents. Tenant and investor demand for apartments and warehouses is deep at all price points and almost every market, but the story is more nuanced for office and retail.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!71:  Class A property investments align with rent-by-choice higher- income households and a swelling population of aging Americans ready to downsize and simplify. B and C value-add investments suit a growing market of younger and mid-career households stuck in the limbo of scarce supply, high prices, and high interest mortgages that will delay their becoming homeowners. Closing a gaping, and widening, chasm in new investment and development would well serve households in the 80 to 120 percent range of area median household income levels the wage range of many essential workers such as teachers, sanitation workers, law enforcement officers, and fire and medical first responders. Furthermore, addressing this missing middle household income level does not preclude the need for additions to and preservation of properties for lower-income households. The Great Bottleneck: Local Ballot Boxes Apartment stakeholders number-one nemesis, blocking private- sector market solutions to deep and growing mismatches between demand and supply, is a many-headed hydraa bevy of deep-rooted restrictive land use, permitting, and regulatory cost burdens that thwart higher-density multifamily develop- ment. On top of these longstanding challenges, a growing push for rent regulation is adding uncertainty to the market. For example, while 26 states prohibit local municipalities from implementing rent control laws, five states permit localities to enforce rent controlNew York, New Jersey, California, Oregon, and Marylandas well as Washington, D. C. Regulations being proposed throughout the country would allow landlords to boost monthly rents by no more than 2 percent to 10 percent. Arizona, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, Washington, and Massachusetts have all introduced proposals to add or expand rent control protections. The problem of impact fees and NIMBYism really dominates many markets and makes it too expensive to develop, the CEO of one of the nations largest property management organizations says. I think were still stuck in the past. Some policymakers are not in tune. Voters who may not be well versed in these issues elect government officials who then become a huge wall to economic solutions. I dont see solutions for all this happening in my lifetime.;\n\nreal_estate_index:bouwinvest_international-market-outlook_2023-2025-1.pdf-!3:  The residential sector as a whole is a beneficiary of the ongoing trend of urbanisation in major cities across Europe. Wealth tends to be concentrated in larger urban centres with better employment opportunities where the average age of the working population is lower than in regional and more remote communities. Demand for living assets remains strong in most urbanised areas due to demographic growth and the rising number of households, boosted by immigration and the expanding number of younger and older people living alone. The volume of new housing developments is also falling due to increasingly stringent environmental rules, shortages of materials and rising labour costs. Demand continues to outstrip supply, especially in the affordable segment. If the number of new-build projects continues to decline, the valuations of existing stock may hold up relatively well. Increases in mortgage rates mean home ownership will move out of reach of a growing group of people, forcing them to turn to the rental market for accommodation that fits their budgets. Residential real estate is seen as a relatively good inflation hedge as most rental contracts are index-linked but, in our view, it will not be possible to pass on the full level of consumer price rises to tenants. Governments in many countries are implementing measures to offset energy price hikes or cap rental increases to support the purchasing power of people living in social housing and other low- to middle-income tenants. Rising 10-year government bond yields will simultaneously pressure spread levels and yields will move out. This is demonstrated in the graph below which tracks the expected development of residential net initial yields against 10-year government bond levels for the leading European gateway cities.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!19:  One of our key themes last year was Everyone Wants In, reflecting the deep and wide investor demand for just about every type of real estate, except central business district (CBD) office and regional malls. Sales volumes jumped to over $800 billion in 2021, according to MSCI Real Assetsalmost double the depressed total in the first pandemic year of 2020 and nearly one-third more than the prior $600 billion record reached in 2019. The surge continued into 2022, with sales volumes in the first half of the year up 38 percent over the same period last year, as even the sharp rise in interest rates did little to dampen transaction volumes. But these recent volumes do not tell the whole storyand the story they do tell may be misleading as to where property markets seem to be heading. Discussions with numerous participants from all corners of the industry confirm that many investors have moved to the sidelinesor to other types of assets like equities and bonds. Indeed, the recent surge may well reflect a last gasp to get deals done before the expected increase in interest rates. Fewer Investors Fewer investors and lenders will be providing capital for assets, according to this years Emerging Trends survey: expectations of availability declined for every one of the 13 equity and debt capital sources. Over the past decade, CRE markets benefited from a substantial capital inflow as alternative investment classes have gained wider acceptance and real estate offered compel- ling risk-adjusted returns. Now, some of those inflows look to reverse. Investor interest is still healthy, but not what it was. Instead of seven or 10 competing offers for sale, theres now two or three, which I think thats normal, says the head of an investment firm. Thats normalizing, too. Several forces look to restrict investor demand, starting with the lower expected returns discussed in our Normalizing trend. Rising interest rates are making acquisition and construc- tion debt more expensive, just when operating incomes seem destined to slide as the economy weakens in the forecasted downturn. Indeed, the prospect of lower income and higher costs is breaking deals, as buyers either seek price breaks or pull out altogether.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, the market for value-add investments is growing, particularly among younger and mid-career households.

LOOKING AHEAD  The relentless math of higher interest rates will continue to weigh heavily on real estate values, at least until interest rates stabilize as inflation begins to subside. The bid- ask spread for private real estate should eventually close and transactions will resume in earnest at a rebased level.  In the meantime, investment styles that are less sensitive to volatility in values should be contemplated, such as floating-rate lending with a comfortable cushion from lower loan-to-value ratios. Debt investment can be attractive at times of uncertainty, as investors tilt toward contractually certain income and away from an uncertain upside. Portfolio aggregation strategies with smaller asset sizes that lend themselves to averaging-in with diversified timing of entry points represent another way to cope with volatile and uncertain values.  The inputs to the math are not changing to the same degree in every part of the world. Wherever rate spikes are less intense, or the prospects for rental growth are clearest, transaction activity and prices have been less impacted.  In addition to debt costs, investors should also consider the trajectory of cash flows, which depend on economic fundamentals and real estate occupier market conditions. The differential prospects for real estate cash flows are the subject of the next section.;\n\nreal_estate_index:global-real-estate-markets-2023.pdf-!1:  We also dive into student housing in the US, another sector booming among investors, and what impact demographic trends might have on it. In addition, we analyze how opportunistic and value-add managers will need to adopt their strategies now that interest rates are higher, and how their ability to generate out-size returns simply by adding leverage is gone. So, a number of important topics for us and investors to consider. We hope you find our answers insightful and useful in determining your strategy and thinking about some of the key questions in real estate as we move into the new year. Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy. Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs. We have already started to see cap rates and yields rise in many markets, with the most rapid adjustment taking place in the UK. However, we do not think that prices fully reflect higher interest rates yet. To assess when values might bottom out, we can look to past downturns and the listed market for guidance. In the Global Financial Crisis, for example, global capital values bottomed out in 4Q09, while GDP across global real estate markets troughed three quarters earlier, in 1Q09, as did global listed real estate prices1. Market downturns usually present opportunities, and one we expect for investors in 2023 is a correction in pricing as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. Although we do not expect large amounts of distress in the market, we do expect some, already apparent in parts of the UK market. This should allow investors access to assets at attractive pricing. The early 1990s downturn was longer, with US capital values continuing to decline into 1995. We expect modest declines in GDP in the first half of 2023 before growth resumes.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!20:  10 Exhibit 1-6 Availability of Capital for Real Estate, 2023 versus 2022 2023 2022 Lending source Nonbank nancial institutions Debt funds Government-sponsored enterprises Insurance companies Mortgage REITs Commercial banks Securitized lendersCMBS Equity source Private-equityopportunity hedge funds Foreign investors Private REITs Private local investors Institutional investors pension funds Public-equity REITs 3.05 3.44 2.99 3.26 2.97 3.39 2.83 3.44 2.72 3.42 2.58 3.63 2.56 3.61 3.18 3.74 3.09 3.54 3.00 3.59 2.98 3.66 2.89 3.67 2.73 3.40 2023 2022 1 2 Large decline 3 Stay the same 4 5 Large increase Source: Emerging Trends in Real Estate surveys. Note: Based on U. S. respondents only. Says the regional leader of one global firm, Cap rates have gapped out as interest rates went up. And suddenly, things didnt pencil, and that generated broken deals. The cost of financing for real estate and everything else went up dramatically. And so everything has to be repriced, everything has to be reset. Also limiting investor demand: debt is getting more difficult to obtain, and the Emerging Trends survey expects underwriting standards to get even more rigorous. As the partner in one lead- ing advisory firm explains, This is one of those cash is king situations where borrowing costs are higher, and if youre an all- cash buyer, those probably represent a disproportionate share of the people in the market today. Meanwhile, the same interest rate increases that reduce lever- aged returns and thus demand for real estate also make bonds and other interest-bearing investments more compelling. As the head of real estate banking at one investment bank explains, Rising bond yields are going to mean that real estate and other alternatives are all going to be facing less availability of capital and some outflows.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!13:  More than half believe that capitalization rates are heading up next year and returns are coming down, primarily due to rising interest rates and cost of capital, which was the top economic concern voiced in our survey. After more than a decade of lower for longer, the Fed is finally normalizing interest rates closer to historical levels. Those rising interest rates are already driving up debt costs and thus the costs to acquire and develop property, reducing leveraged returns. At the same time, the federal government is done with providing stimulus, indirectly reducing tenant demand for space. Unlike in the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and during the pandemic, nobodys coming to the rescue, and now we got to take our medicine, and here it comes, says the head of research for an investment management firm. Thus, the government is turning off both the monetary and fiscal spigots that had been support- ing commercial real estate and the economy overall. The head of a development company summarized it like this: I feel like weve been on a little bit of a sugar high with this stimu- lus and cheap debt. Theres going to be a slowdown. Theres got to be this normalization. So, what does that mean? I think its going to be a little bouncy. Its going to be a little bit turbulent. But then we bottom out, and we start back into growth. 2.  Still, Weve Changed Some  The pandemic forced structural shifts in how and where we live, work, and recreate in ways that seem destinated to endure.  Online spending is receding from its pandemic peaks but is not likely to revert to pre-pandemic levels. Business travel is unlikely to recover to pre-COVID levels for at least several years, meaning business hotels, fine dining, and conference facilities will continue to face challenges.  The greatest changes may be in how and where we work. The impact on office use and leasing is still evolving, and a significant share of the existing stock may need to be reposi- tioned to remain competitive.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, you can link the escalating capitalization rates and dwindling returns to heightened interest rates and the escalating cost of capital, as discerned in the American real estate market.

Meanwhile, apartment rents have continued to push ever higher, but the pace has been moderating in recent months. Construction starts also have slowed. The National Association of Home Builders housing market index has fallen for eight straight months through August 2022 to its lowest level since May 2020. This is not to say that were in a housing recessionfar from it. Homes are still selling at a healthy rate by historical levels, and home prices remain near record levels. And while multifamily vacancies are at their lowest level in four decades and rents continue to log new records every month, the rates of increase have been slowing and are expected to decelerate further, according to many experts we interviewed. Maybe you dont see the 10 percentplus rent growth in multifamily markets, says the head of one institutional investment advisory firm. They should come back to more of a long-term historical average of 3 percent to 4 percent, and maybe offset some of the unafford- ability in the country. Indeed, housing markets may be partly victims of their own success as record prices and rents mean fewer households can afford to buy homes or rent apartments, particularly with mort- gage interest rates and housing-related expenses like utilities 6 rising sharplya topic we explore in Too Much for Too Many, our trend on housing affordability. The Amazon Pause The white-hot industrial market also seems set to cool after sev- eral years of unprecedented demand growth and rent gains that have pushed rents far above prior records. Growth in e-com- merce is slowing and giving back some of the market share it captured from physical retailers during the pandemic. Amazon, the largest warehouse user in the United States, has delayed occupying numerous completed projects, trying to sublet many, as it slows its physical growthwhat some are calling the Amazon pause. Other major retailers also have been cutting back their distribution expansion plans. To be sure, the industrial sector still enjoys record-low vacancy rates, as demand for high-quality, well-located logistics facilities has been running ahead of the markets ability to supply them.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2023_Housing_market_outlook__Price_dip_and_interes.pdf-!2:  For example, the press releases of the Federal Statistical Office reported further price increases until the third quarter, although the price index had already passed its peak. It was not until the fourth quarter that the price index of the Federal Statistical Office fell by 3.6 year-on-year and by as much as 5 compared with the previous quarter. The bulwiengesa data also indicated a further rise in prices, as the annual data published on December 10 are annual averages and the quarterly data are rolling four- quarter averages. In addition, transactions are only indirectly included in the time series via analysts. Higher-frequency and transaction-based time series are therefore more in focus. The monthly Europace index, for example, has been falling since the spring of 2022. From peak to trough, prices for existing homes fell by around 12, and the index for apartments by as much as 15. However, prices for new homes initially ran sideways and then recently picked up again. In February 2023, the most recent data point, new home prices even increased strongly by more than 2 from the previous month. All three price indices are also published as hedonic indices, which factor out differences in quality. Since the spring of 2022, these have recorded an increase of almost 5 for new houses, and a drop of more than 8 for existing houses and apartments. The hedonic price indices are thus rising more strongly or falling less. The sharp price declines in the non-hedonic price indices are evidently also due to the fact that it is primarily properties of lower quality that are changing hands. The vdp indices which are calculated exclusively on a hedonic basis confirm this statement. These indices which are published quarterly only began to fall in the second half of the year. In the metropolitan areas , apartments, single- family houses and multi-family houses fell by around 3 from their high point in the second quarter. Nationwide, prices for both single-family houses and condominiums were down by only around 1 . These indices thus also support our expectation that prices will ease only slightly. In the course of 2023, the focus is likely to be on the transaction-based indices of Europace and vdp.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!25:  Exhibit 1-10 Median Price of Existing Single-Family Homes, Nominal versus Real Prices, 19542022 20 15 10 5 0 5 10 15 Nominal price Real price 1954 1958 1962 1966 1970 1974 1978 1982 1986 1990 1994 1998 2002 2006 2010 2014 2018 2022 Source: DQYDJ. com based on data from the National Association of Realtors, Robert Shiller, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Compiled by Nelson Economics. Though prices began to fall modestly in the summer, as we discuss in the Normalizing trend, prices are still near record levels nationally. The rise in mortgage rates alone has had a significant impact. John Burns Real Estate Consulting calculated that the number of U. S. households that could afford a $400,000 mortgageabout the mortgage amount required to purchase the median-priced home with a 5 percent downpaymentdropped by 16.5 million due to rising interest rates, just in the first half of 2022. That hurts. But the fundamental issue is the overall chronic undersupply of housing, especially at affordable price points. The challenges are hardly new. Restrictive zoning and build- ing codes block or limit new supply, while NIMBYism delays and curbs approvals of even as-of-right projects. Affordable housing developers complain that increasingly complex deals now require more underwriting from more capital sources. One developer says, The average deal for us used to take 90 days to close, and now its over six months. Some experts we interviewed believe that the rise of single- family rentals (SFRs) also contributes to declining affordability of for-sale housing. Proponents argue that SFRs extend the opportunity to live in a single-family house to those who cannot afford to buy or just dont want to, while generally expanding the supply of rental housing. But critics point out that institutional capital is driving up prices in the resale market, in the words of one housing adviser, by outbidding owneroccupant homebuy- ers for existing homes.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Deloitte 2023 Commercial Real Estate Outlook.pdf-!28:  Everett-Allen, House prices in global cities rising at their fastest rate since Q3 2004, Knight Frank Research, 12.

Nonetheless, the glow for this category has faded somewhat as their unfettered growth has invited some big-city problems like congestion and rising living costs. Last years shooting star, Boise, fell sharply after two years in the top 20. Raleigh has continued its modest decline, from the top-rated market in 2021 to number six in the 2023 survey. But more broadly, the Supernovas appear to be suffering some growing pains, as discussed elsewhere in this report. Housing construction is not keeping pace with household growth, strain- ing housing affordability, which has been one of the chief attractions. The Establishment The Establishment markets have long been the nations eco- nomic engines. The 20 markets in this category produce almost 43 percent of the GMP in the 80 Emerging Trends markets while accounting for only 34 percent of its population base. This pri- marily reflects the outsized contributions of the nations gateway markets, which we refer to as the Knowledge and Innovation Centers. Though growing more slowly than the Magnet markets, the Establishment markets still offer tremendous opportunities. This groups average rating is second among our four major group- ings. However, the appeal of these markets to investors and developers has waned in recent years as growth has slowed across many of these markets while challenges have increased. Multitalented Producers. Though all the Establishment markets are large and economically varied, some are more diverse than others, specifically the multitalented metro areas of Chicago, Los Angeles, San Jose, and Seattle. Workers here tend to be productive, with per capita GMP ranking the second highest of any of the subgroups. Though their elevated cost of doing business and getting deals done limits their appeal for some real estate professionals, the Multitalented Producers Exhibit 3-8 U.

Many of the changes were relatively minor, and nine of the 10 highest-rated markets last year repeated this year . But there were some material changes over the year as about a quarter of markets moved up or down in rankings by at least 10 places. And consistent with our normal- izing trend, many of the markets near the top of the standings last year have fallen this year, while many previously lower- rate markets have risen: More than half (11) of the 20-highest rated markets in last years survey fell in the rankings this year, although almost all by less than 10 places. Meanwhile, some of the markets that were found lower in the rankings in prior years are now finding more support. Thirteen of the 20-lowest rated markets in last years survey rose in the rankings this year. Some Like It Hot Despite the modest drop in the Supernova ratings this year, Emerging Trends survey respondents still see the best prospects in Sun Belt metropolitan areas, which have been growing over time. The number of Sun Belt markets among the top 20 markets for overall prospects has increased from 10 in 2011 to 14 in each of the past two years. At the same time, the number of markets in cold-weather climates in the Northeast and Midwest has declined from five to just two . These climate preferences are even stronger at the top and bot- tom of the rankings.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!132:  Only Boston remains among the 20 top-rated markets.

This group includes the markets sur- rounding high-cost CBDs in Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, San Francisco, and Washington, D. C. Though most are subur- ban in character, some are more urban. Moreover, several are or contain metropolitan statistical areas in their own right. Many of these markets benefited from the out-migration from their neighboring CBDs during the pandemic, and their prospects have improved somewhat in the eyes of survey respondents. But here, too, there is a diversity in trends as seven of the 12 markets improved this year and five declined. Most of the improvement was registered in the New York metropolitan area, while the declining markets are mainly in California. Exhibit 3-9 U. S.

Growth Attracts Its not heat and humidity that investors and developers seek in the Sun Belt markets, of course, but strong market prospects. And forecasts for population and especially economic growth show that are looking in the right places. Population and gross metro product (GMP) are both expected to grow far faster in the Magnet markets than just about anywhere else in the nation, particularly in the northern markets that constitute much of the Backbone markets. last four years to 1.6 percent over the next fivestill the highest of any subgroup but slower than before as these markets experi- ence some growing pains that we highlighted in our trends chapter. Also of note is that many of the Establishment markets that lost population during the pandemic are expected to reverse course and resume growth over the next few years. This growth will be slower than in our other market groups but represents the biggest increase from the recent past to the expected near term. This reversal perhaps accounts for the modest relative improve- ment in the 2023 ratings of the markets in this group. Accordingly, the Magnets have maintained their dominance at the top of the Emerging Trends ratings. Although their average ranking slipped slightly this year, more markets moved up than down. Growth is expected to be greatest in the Supernova subgroup but moderating from its recent torrid pace. For example, popula- tion growth is projected to slow from 1.9 percent annually over the Affordability Matters, Too Quality of life and affordability also matter. Many of the markets that received relatively lower scores this year have inadequate infrastructure for their population size and growth, here measured by their transit availability score.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, 13 of the 20 lowest-ranked markets from the previous year's survey experienced an increase in rankings this year .\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

Another such mechanism is the denominator effect. This involves comparing real-time values from public markets to lagging valuation-based assessments of private market portfolios, causing some investors to conclude that they are suddenly overweight in the unlisted assets compared to their target allocation. Either way, the downward direction of the pricing pressure is clear and it will likely persist as long as the all-in cost of debt is dilutive to leveraged returns. Given the same inputs, the math works the same way all over the world. But today those inputs to the math vary greatly, depending on local circumstances. In Japan, debt costs have moved far less than in other parts of the world, as inflation remains subdued and the Bank of Japan continues to exercise yield curve control . By contrast, Europes real estate yield starting point was exceptionally low and market interest rates have moved up much more markedly, making the math that much more impactful. Government policy also matters. As central banks seek to choke off inflation by tightening monetary policy, there is at least the reasonable expectation that some of that inflation will be passed into rents and thus property cash flows. But when governments employ long-term borrowing to bail out energy consumers in the short term, as is necessary in Europe, interest rates are pushed up further and the impact on property values may be more detrimental. As the UKs recent experience would suggest, credit markets can react swiftly to reflect changes in perceived debt sustainability.

Investors should receive similar ex ante returns for similar risks, or else any free lunches will be arbitraged away. In practice, private market real estate pricing tends to be impacted by broader capital market shifts mainly when there are changes in the cost of real estate debt, since the marginal buyer of income-producing real estate is most often a leveraged buyer. When debt costs rise, the market thins before price pressures are reflected in transactions. This tends to create a time lag between higher interest rates and declines in private equity real estate pricing. In most markets globally, we are now feeling the impact of more expensive real estate debt, which in many cases is no longer accretive to returns at current private market valuations. The math of debt costs and going-in yields is relentless. When the yield starting point is especially low in absolute terms, modest increases in debt costs and yields as measured in basis points mathematically translate into big percentage changes in capital values. As such, evidence of the most significant repricing to date has been concentrated in the lowest- yielding sectors, where transactions have held up most. This has surprised some observers since these low-yielding property types are mostly the winning sectors of recent years and they continue to possess attractive growth profiles. That some of the largest recent value declines may be occurring in the most sought- after property types, such as logistics and residential, might come as a shock after years of banner outperformance, especially during the pandemic. Even so, these property types remain the strongest performers over longer trailing periods and values have also fallen in the less favored sectors, although such adjustments are masked by lower price transparency in these property types. This repricing has been labeled mechanical by some because it is a function of exogenous debt assumptions increasing in investors spreadsheets.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!16:  G LO BA L 2 The path of fundamentals will ultimately help determine where values settle Early in 2022, we framed the impact of rising inflation and interest rates on values as a race between debt costs and net operating income growth, as we anticipated that higher inflation would translate into higher rents in some sectors. Currently, it seems that debt costs are mostly winning the race. Ultimately, however, valuations are the result of the interaction between higher debt costs and the path of real estate fundamentals, the prospects for which vary widely across sectors and geographies. Tracing back real estate cash flows to their drivers is to follow a chain of causation back to basic variables like population, GDP, industrial production, consumer spending and employment. All of these interact with real estate factors, such as the balance of property supply and occupier demand, to influence property cash flows. Secular megatrends and structural features like legal and contractual constraints also matter. Going into 2023, there is increased uncertainty in many of these variables, especially the economic ones, given the pace of economic expansion is expected to be weaker or negative. This will have a cooling impact on property NOI growth, but nuances remain given that the transmission of macroeconomic conditions to real estate is a winding path. Starting with the underlying economic fundamentals, we are seeing a great deal of variation globally. In addition to the dimensions of depth and duration, a key uncertainty surrounding the coming downturn is how widespread it will be. Europe faces especially severe challenges stemming from an energy price shock, with ripple effects of unknown global scope. The dominant driver of inflation in the US, Canada and Singapore is that their economies are robust and operating close to full capacity. Demand- led inflation is relatively benign compared to inflation from a supply shock, but the central banks in these countries must still raise interest rates, either to manage their domestic economic situations or because their monetary policies are linked to the US Federal Reserve . Rising interest rates create clear risks to economic growth, with housing markets already being impacted by higher mortgage rates. Europes employment picture is also solid, but in addition to home-grown inflation, it is coping with a severe, energy-driven supply shock caused by the Russia-Ukraine war.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!15: 5 Spiking rates drive rapid tightening of financial conditions Cost of capital rising sharply in most geographies Nominal corporate bond yields 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 7 0 n a J 8 0 n a J 9 0 n a J 0 1 n a J 1 1 n a J 2 1 n a J 3 1 n a J 4 1 n a J 5 1 n a J 6 1 n a J 7 1 n a J 8 1 n a J 9 1 n a J 0 2 n a J 1 2 n a J 2 2 n a J US C.

LOOKING AHEAD  The relentless math of higher interest rates will continue to weigh heavily on real estate values, at least until interest rates stabilize as inflation begins to subside. The bid- ask spread for private real estate should eventually close and transactions will resume in earnest at a rebased level.  In the meantime, investment styles that are less sensitive to volatility in values should be contemplated, such as floating-rate lending with a comfortable cushion from lower loan-to-value ratios. Debt investment can be attractive at times of uncertainty, as investors tilt toward contractually certain income and away from an uncertain upside. Portfolio aggregation strategies with smaller asset sizes that lend themselves to averaging-in with diversified timing of entry points represent another way to cope with volatile and uncertain values.  The inputs to the math are not changing to the same degree in every part of the world. Wherever rate spikes are less intense, or the prospects for rental growth are clearest, transaction activity and prices have been less impacted.  In addition to debt costs, investors should also consider the trajectory of cash flows, which depend on economic fundamentals and real estate occupier market conditions. The differential prospects for real estate cash flows are the subject of the next section.;\n***\n[Submission]: No, we cannot deduce that escalating debt expenses are the sole factor influencing property evaluations.

As a look at the early 1990s shows, prime real estate yields can even be below bond yields. Such a constellation presupposes high rental growth expectations. Given the current macro environment, we believe that investor expectations of rental growth are not sufficiently high for this in any sector. The logistics market and the less regulated part of the residential market might be an exception. But here, too, the uncertainty about further developments is likely to be too great, at least temporarily. Another relevant lower edge for property yields is financing costs. At the end of the third quarter of 2022, prime yields in all major market segments were below the cost of debt capital . This situation could only persist if the number of equity buyers is sufficiently large. Indeed, such investors are currently quite active and are taking advantage of the lower prices for purchases. However, we think it unlikely that the existing equity volume will be sufficient to anchor prices below the cost of financing. The fact that the increase in initial yields is nevertheless likely to be comparatively flat is also due to the mostly comfortable financing situation on the part of the landlords. Apart from the project development segment, we expect few forced sales. We rule out a wave of non-performing loans like after the financial crisis. Nevertheless, the steep rise in interest rates is likely to put individual landlords under stress, especially in the value-add and opportunistic segments, where financing durations are typically short. Lower demand for space and rents due to the recession could jeopardise the implementation of the business plan and thus also refinancing.;\n\nreal_estate_index:outlook-real-estatet-market-germany-dec-2022.pdf-!11:  In our view, it should be borne in mind that, unlike after the financial crisis, the banks are unlikely to have any incentive to postpone the Graph 6: Risk-free rate and property yield Spread office-to-bund Prime office yield Bund 10yrs 10 8 6 4 2 0 -2 -4 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021 2023 en. savills. deresearch 7 Source Bulwiegesa, Bundesbank, Focus Economics, Savills German property market outlook In addition to refinancing issues, there are other reasons for an increasing number of sales. these aspects cannot be determined, but the negative factors clearly outweigh the positive ones.

Nevertheless, the volume of demand will remain considerably lower than during the 202122 turn-of-the-year summit. workout of non-performing loans. Two factors play a role here: Firstly, loan-to-value ratios are only rarely likely to exceed 100, even after value adjustments have been taken into account. In this case, a bank would not suffer any damage from a workout. Secondly, in an environment of rising interest rates, lenders can use the equity released from repaid loans to grant new, higher-interest loans. In this respect, it could be that lenders in many cases are aiming for a speedy redemption of loans. In addition to refinancing issues, there are other reasons for an increasing number of sales. For example, the devaluation of equities and bonds may have led to real estate quotas above target in some portfolios. This could trigger sales. Liquidity bottlenecks in open-end funds due to cash outflows could also make sales necessary. Against this backdrop and based on our observation that the number of sales processes started has already risen in recent weeks, we expect more supply again in perspective than recently. The big unknown is how much demand this supply will be matched by.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!59:  1 2 - c e D 2 2 - n a J 2 2 - b e F 2 2 - r a M 2 2 - r p A 2 2 - y a M 2 2 - n u J 2 2 - u J l 2 2 - g u A 2 2 - p e S 2 2 - t c O 2 2 - v o N Date of forecast GDP Forecast for: US 2023 Canada 2023 US 2024 Canada 2024 Source: Oxford Economics, as of November 16, 2022. around long-term interest rates and pricing than around near-term economic growth and real estate fundamentals. We are reluctant to make investment decisions based solely on a view of future interest rates, but acknowledge that real estate pricing is linked to future interest rates. Given this dynamic, we recommend investors consider a range of interest rate scenarios . Interest rate increases and the relentless math Each time interest rates ticked higher since the GFC, the question of when higher debt costs would impact real estate values was asked. It was a speculative question, with the underlying assumption that rate increases thus far had not yet impacted values. Regardless of the answer then, it became very clear in 2022 that the relentless math of higher borrowing rates was having an impact on leveraged returns and asset values . The boost investors were getting from borrowing has shifted to a drag on a cash basis, but with unleveraged internal rates of return generally above borrowing rates, leverage is still marginally accretive on a total return basis. However, with less lift from borrowing, leveraged buyers are largely out of the market . Higher borrowing rates are a function of both higher indices and increased borrowing spreads. Lending volume is down significantly and lenders are becoming more conservative. The supply of debt capital from large money center banks is down due to large positions taken in the first half of 2022 coupled with stress testing.

Note: Based on U. S. respondents only. Says the regional leader of one global firm, Cap rates have gapped out as interest rates went up. And suddenly, things didnt pencil, and that generated broken deals. The cost of financing for real estate and everything else went up dramatically. And so everything has to be repriced, everything has to be reset. Also limiting investor demand: debt is getting more difficult to obtain, and the Emerging Trends survey expects underwriting standards to get even more rigorous. As the partner in one lead- ing advisory firm explains, This is one of those cash is king situations where borrowing costs are higher, and if youre an all- cash buyer, those probably represent a disproportionate share of the people in the market today. Meanwhile, the same interest rate increases that reduce lever- aged returns and thus demand for real estate also make bonds and other interest-bearing investments more compelling. As the head of real estate banking at one investment bank explains, Rising bond yields are going to mean that real estate and other alternatives are all going to be facing less availability of capital and some outflows.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, purchasers paying in cash came to the fore in the market towards the end of 2022 due to the escalating borrowing expenses and prime yields being beneath the cost of debt capital.

This is reflected in consumer sentiment which has fallen to a historic low. The GfK survey shows that income expectations have slumped to an even greater degree than the propensity to buy. This is bad news for city centre retail in two respects, with the need to make savings driving consumer spending down further. Nominal wages are rising comparatively strongly in 2022, however the growth is being more than offset by high inflation, probably of an annual average rate close to 8 per cent. Below the line, spending power is falling significantly, much more steeply than in the last three decades. While low inflation has supported retail activity since 2012 in the form of real wage growth, the opposite is now the case. Busy shopping centres and restaurants convey a different picture. However, house- holds are reluctant to spend. The German Federal Statistical Office reported an infla- tion-adjusted decline of 9 per cent in retail sales in June 2022 compared to the same month last year. Consequently, nominal and real retail sales diverged sharply at mid- year. The music sector is another example. Tickets for some concerts are selling so slowly that tours have already been cancelled.

Germany's affordability indicator calculated in this way currently stands at 110 index points, with the long-term average normalized to 100. The high point was reached at 115 index points at the end of 2021. The price-to-rent ratio currently stands at 131 index points, also slightly below the high point of 133 index points. In past housing market outlooks, we defined reaching the 80 percentile, which is around 120 index points for both indices, as a point of reference for a potential end to the house price cycle. In principle, this rule of thumb has proved helpful. The OECD database also allows the length of house price cycles to be calculated. Based on inflation-adjusted price indices, the cycle lasted 53 quarters from the second quarter of 2009 to the second quarter of 2022. Adjusted for inflation, German house prices increased by 62 and by 103 in nominal terms.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!76: 7 5.7 36.9 -0.3 6,900 12,650 8.7 14.3 3.6 16.3 1.0 5,300 12,400 6.9 13.8 3.0 9.5 3.1 14,700 22,100 5.9 17.3 0.6 16.1 2.4 46,100 47,500 7.1 15.7 3.3 14.6 1.6 34,300 40,700 4.5 20.8 1.5 15.6 -0.3 1,000 8,300 4.6 16.9 1.8 22.5 2.0 178,000 227,300 6.7 16.7 3.5 23.3 Source: bulwiengesa, Destatis, Scope, cities The supply of housing is expected to remain tight at the same time as demand is likely to pick up again. Large numbers of refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine have ar- rived in Germany and they could to be joined by many urgently needed skilled work- ers in future, pointing to a fresh acceleration in rents. However, it remains to be seen whether this actually happens. Households are being hit hard by high inflation and especially by the rise in energy prices. The latter is also affecting the economy which teeters on the brink of a recession, which in turn could dampen the labour market and hence household incomes. Rent regulation also suggests that sharp rent increases are unlikely, at least in the case of flats covered by the rent cap. The reason for this is the that Mietspiegel review period  already extended from four to six years and which the government plans to extend to seven years  has dampened the normal local comparable rent as a basis for rent rises.;\n***\n[Submission]: Answer: According to , the average monthly disposable income per household in Euro is EUR 3.726.\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

Schumpeters viewpoints were shaped by being an escapee of both the rise of fascism in 1930s Germany and of Soviet-style communism of the 1950sregimes that came to power through sham elections. Like the 2525 video, reading Schumpeter reminds us how the past, present and future all intersect. Geopolitical events in LaSalles target countries are as difficult to predict as the idiosyncratic motivations of their leaders. As researchers, we cannot know the future, but we can help devise strategies to cope with whatever alternative futures may arise. The forces of nationalism, authoritarianism and a distrust of globalism may represent a temporary triumph of politics over economics. Over the long term, though, the power of open markets remains a force to be reckoned with and not to be underestimated. Likewise, well-constructed and well-located properties can thrive even during periods of great political turmoil. Successful real estate investing rests on identification of timeless attributes that are successful over the course of several cycles. These attributes must be appropriately priced and they must also adapt to trends in demographics, technology, urbanization and environmental factors. This triangle of timelessness, adaptation and fair value pricing forms the foundation for successful real estate investing. As I hand over the reins of LaSalles research to a new generation of researchers, I sense that the past, present and future will continue to intersect and to overlap. The awarding of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Economics was based in part on an analysis of the Great Depression of the 1930s. We have learned much about credit cycles and the role of banks in maintaining or losing confidence in market institutions. At the same time, the events of 2022 in Ukraine and elsewhere show how unpredictable the course of human events can be. The semi-predictable path of rising C02 levels is leading to weather volatility along with rising atmospheric and oceanic temperatures.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!47:  NOAAs National Centers for Environmental Information calculates that the annual number of billion-dollar events (inflation-adjusted) in the United States has been increasing rapidly in recent decades, rising from about three per year in the 1980s to over 20 in the 2020s. More disturbing is the increase in severe summer storms, excluding climate events like drought, flooding, and wildfires. The number of billion-dollar severe storms has jumped from less than one per year in the 1980s to 12 in this decadea 15-fold increase in less than 40 years and trending further upward. Just in the recent summer of 2022, we experienced five once-in- a-1,000-year storms in Dallas, Death Valley, central and southern Illinois, Kentucky, and St. Louis, which recorded the most intense rainfall in the citys history. These storms demonstrate that build- ings and infrastructure are poorly equipped to withstand the changing climatemuch less what might be coming. There is still a political divide in the country about what is to blame for climate change, and what, if anything, to do about it. But there is now growing agreement about its prevalence. Fully two-thirds of Americans surveyed by the Pew Research Center in 2021 believe that extreme weather events across the United States occur more often than in the past. Close to half say that it is hitting close to home as their community has recently experienced severe weather like floods and intense storms or long periods of unusually hot weather . Last year in these pages, we highlighted the role of commercial real estate in acceleratingor potentially mitigatingclimate change, in a trend we called Climate Risks Are on Us. Despite recent calls by some CRE leaders that we should deemphasize ESG issues now as we grapple with growing economic threats, many in our industry are continuing to answer societys call to do even more to reduce our carbon footprint. But with climate risks climbing still further, this year we highlight climates impact on us as owners, managers, and users of real propertyand how our industry can proactively address the impacts of climate change on our assets. Hotter, More Expensive Summers Several themes stand out.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!50:  Because extreme weather events occur so infrequently in any one location, the odds are low that anything will happen on your watch, especially if youre managing or holding the asset for only a few years. Thus, asset managers, who typically rotate every few years, often prefer to protect their buildings through insurance rather than upgrading them to withstand the extreme weather better but likely would be more expensive in the short term. That calculus could change if insurance costs are allowed to rise to reflect the full risks of climate change. In many high-risk areas, insurance is subsidized, or insurers are limited in what 25 they can charge, creating a moral hazard that encourages owners to locate in risky regions and not undertake sensible physical improvements. I would prefer that they bear the price of that amenity and location fully, and they dont, says one academic. But I think were moving in that direction. When the insurance costs reflect the reality, and when the mortgage risks reflect the reality, the market will start to work. That would be a step forward but not the total solution. In ULIs 2022 report Enhancing Resilience through Neighborhood-Scale Strategies, the global head of ESG strategy for an investment management firm explained that insurance is not a substitute for building resilience: Now investors understand the need to model climate risk over a longer period of time. Insurance can protect us against damage loss but not demographic or investor sentiment changes. Its a race against timeand climate change. 10. Action through Regulation?  Pressures for greater ESG disclosure by real estate owners and investors are intensifying due to efforts both from indus- try groups like NCREIF and PREA and from government regulation by the SEC.  As shelter costs increasingly strain household budgets, state and local governments are resorting to regulation to address affordability, including various types of rent control and vacancy taxes.  While building owners and developers benefit from various government incentives, the industry faces an increasingly challenging set of environmental and economic regulations. Will certain regulations end up being counterproductive? Preceding trends highlighted several areas where private markets have been slow to fix mounting problems that the property sector has played a central role in creating, notably climate change and housing affordability.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2023_Housing_market_outlook__Price_dip_and_interes.pdf-!47:  For example, the impact of the climate crisis on Germany's regions is unclear. But it also remains questionable to what extent it will be possible to contain or even prevent climate damage through behavioural change, construction measures, precautions and good crisis management. The first indications are provided by the extensive data of the German Weather Service. Schleswig-Holstein, for example, tends to have low average summer temperatures, while BerlinBrandenburg tends to have high average temperatures. Historically, the difference between the two regions has averaged about 1.5C, and in recent years it has even been around 2C. Bavaria and Baden-Wrttemberg tend to have higher temperatures than Schleswig-Holstein, probably due to the higher number of sunshine hours. However, they typically also have higher precipitation, making fires and potential water rationing less likely. It also increases the yield of photovoltaic systems, which in turn could reduce utility costs. In general, it should also be true that low and high mountains tend to have higher soil moisture due to lower evapotranspiration. In contrast, BerlinBrandenburg is a rather dry region with a rather high risk of forest fires. Schleswig-Holstein, on the other hand, may be most affected by rising sea levels or the cost of higher dams. In view of the many influencing factors and the unclear regional effects of climate change, it will probably take several years before these are noticeably reflected in the return considerations of investors.;\n***\n[Submission]: Answer: Earthquakes are caused by the movement of tectonic plates .

However, the trend has varied widely from one city to another among the top seven. Take-up in Dsseldorf and above all in Frankfurt was rather low. Whereas the level in Berlin and Munich was roughly back in line with for- mer average figures, it was slightly above in Hamburg and well above in Cologne and Stuttgart. In 2022, after a Covid-led period of weakness, huge interest in new office concepts and modern space in buildings which are as sustainable as possible has led to a sharp rise in prime rents. Prime rents have risen by an average of between just over 4 per cent and over 8 per cent in Berlin and Stuttgart against mid- 2021. At the half-way stage, prime rents ranged from EUR 26 per m2 in Cologne and Stuttgart to EUR 44 per m2 in Frankfurt. The figure in Berlin and Munich is only mar- ginally lower.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!58:  However, the momentum of rental rises clearly lagged behind the trend among the top locations. One of the main rea- sons for this is likely to have been a fairly high vacancy rate  as in Frankfurt  at just under 8 per cent. However, the vacancies mostly involve older office space which is often only marketable to a limited extent. Take-up in the first half of 2022 was around 160,000 m2, slightly less than in previous years. This included two larger lettings  17,500 m2 for the Volkshochschule and 15,000 m2 for Ernst Young. These transactions are also a reflection of the most important ten- ants in the first half, since public sector bodies and consultancies each accounted for roughly one quarter of total take-up. After a higher level of brand-new space coming onto the market in 2020 and 2021 than in previous years, less new space is ex- pected this year and next year, which should slow down the rise in prime rents. The trend in prime rents could be slightly weaker in Dsseldorf than in the other top loca- tions, reflecting not only headwind from the energy crisis and the threat of recession but also quite a high vacancy level.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!61:  VACANCY RATE () 20 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 2002 OFFICE SPACE COMPLETIONS IN FRANKFURT IN M 600,000 500,000 400,000 300,000 200,000 100,000 2003 2006 2009 second half year 2012 2015 2018 first half year 2021 0 1992 1997 Frankfurt 2002 2007 2012 2017 2022e average 1992-2021 Source: bulwiengesa Source: bulwiengesa 37 38 Hamburg: Office space PRIME OFFICE RENT IN EUR PER M 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 2002 2008 2005 Hamburg TAKE-UP IN HAMBURG IN M 700,000 600,000 500,000 400,000 300,000 200,000 100,000 0 2011 2014 2017 2020 2023e Top-7 Regional-12 2005 Hamburg 2008 2011 2014 2017 2020 2023e Top-7 Regional-12 Source: bulwiengesa, DZ BANK forecast Upturn in the Hamburg office market Source: bulwiengesa, DZ BANK forecast Hamburg is the third largest office market in Germany after Hamburg and Berlin and almost on a level with Munich with a stock of 14 million m2. Although prime rents for office space are much cheaper in Hamburg than in Berlin and Munich, being around EUR 10 less per m2, the Hamburg office market has done well in the last few years, driven by a broadly-based economy. Prime rents have risen by a quarter over a five- year period to EUR 32.50 per m2 most recently. Vacancies, which were once high, have been whittled down substantially in view of mostly only moderate volumes of new space.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!49:  New space will also be needed if offices are to be merged. To that extent, surplus space will only gradually be made available in future. This space could remain available in the market, which might lead to a rise in vacan- cies, or, alternatively, office buildings which are no longer economically viable for letting could be pulled down or repurposed. Comparison of office markets in top locations There was little sign of any crisis in the top locations' office markets in the first half. The Covid-led dip in take-up has been largely ironed out by a bounce-back in de- mand for office space since the end of 2021. Take-up in Q2 2022 rose to over 1 mil- lion m2  a figure only exceeded seven times in the 50 quarters since 2010. The ear- lier uptick in vacancies has been brought to a halt by an increase in letting activity. Overall, the vacancy rate rose by 1.5 percentage points to around 4.5 per cent on the back of the pandemic, but as such remains fairly low. Whereas there was a more pronounced variation in the vacancy rate between the seven top locations in the past, two camps have now emerged. At 8 per cent, the vacancy rate in Dsseldorf and Frankfurt is roughly twice that of the five other loca- tions which have figures of 3 to 4 per cent. Prior to Covid, Berlin, Munich and Stuttgart had the lowest vacancy rates. Most recently, though, they have been beat- en by Cologne with a figure of 2.8 per cent.;\n***\n[Submission]: The vacancy rate in Düsseldorf is 8%  and the vacancy rate in Frankfurt is 8% .\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

There will likely also be lasting ramifications for the project of European integration, with outcomes depending on whether European nation-states decide to share the burden or go it alone. It may also reset relations between governments and their people, whose expectations for state intervention to avert negative economic outcomes have rarely been higher. Sharing challenges like inflation, climate change, currency stability, Russian aggression, refugee relief and energy policy may realign UK and EU policies to a greater degree than at any time since the Brexit vote. In real estate terms, the major markets of Europe are highly varied. Yet, when viewed from a global perspective, they are quite like one another in terms of their focus on green building policies, reliance on public transport, cautious approach to new supply and their proximity to an armed conflict. ISA Outlook 2023 38 ISA Outlook 2023 39 G LO BA L A S I A PAC I F I C E U R O P E N O R T H A M E R I CA An unwelcome external shock Russias invasion of Ukraine came at a time when Europe was already embroiled in an economic struggle on multiple fronts. The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated huge government fiscal interventions to support consumers and businesses through periods of mandated closure. These came on the heels of a decade in which sovereign debt crises and austerity had already seen productivity growth stagnate without meaningfully improving sovereign balance sheets in peripheral Europe. Reopening as the pandemic entered the endemic phase saw supply chain stresses and uneven demand patterns drive shortfalls in the availability of goods and labor. The energy supply crunch resulting from European support for Ukraine added a huge exogenous cost shock to the existing global and regional price pressure, driving European inflation readings to the highest level in the world by the end of 2022, on top of the future costs of new commitments to defense spending. The war in Ukraine will eventually end, but barring an unexpected change in Russian leadership, the deflationary impact of its cheap natural gas to heat homes and power industry will not return.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!20:  Although customers are now returning to the high street in greater numbers as Covid measures are relaxed, many no longer have as much money to spend. Inflation has reached levels not seen for decades. In addition to significantly higher food, petrol and diesel prices, heating costs are imposing a particularly heavy financial burden on many households. Nor is the pandemic over yet. It could flare up again with an au- tumn wave and new variants.

This applies mainly to gas which, unlike oil, is not readily available in the world market. Gas prices have exploded because only a fraction of the supply vo- lume is now being delivered, with an adverse impact on consumers and the econo- my. There is also the risk of a complete suspension of the supply. Households and businesses are consequently being urged to conserve energy. Consumers  half of households use gas for heating  are will also have to adjust to high advance pay- ments and additional bills. From October a gas levy of an additional 2.4 cents per kWh will have to be paid.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!22:  c n u m m o c e e l t r e h o t i r e m u s n o c g n d n e p s r e h t o s e s n e p x e s g n v a s i Source: Destatis Interest, gifts, insurance etc Average monthly disposable income per household: EUR 3,726 Euro The war in Ukraine, inflation and the gas crisis are key concerns for people. This is reflected in consumer sentiment which has fallen to a historic low. The GfK survey shows that income expectations have slumped to an even greater degree than the propensity to buy. This is bad news for city centre retail in two respects, with the need to make savings driving consumer spending down further. Nominal wages are rising comparatively strongly in 2022, however the growth is being more than offset by high inflation, probably of an annual average rate close to 8 per cent. Below the line, spending power is falling significantly, much more steeply than in the last three decades. While low inflation has supported retail activity since 2012 in the form of real wage growth, the opposite is now the case. Busy shopping centres and restaurants convey a different picture. However, house- holds are reluctant to spend. The German Federal Statistical Office reported an infla- tion-adjusted decline of 9 per cent in retail sales in June 2022 compared to the same month last year. Consequently, nominal and real retail sales diverged sharply at mid- year. The music sector is another example. Tickets for some concerts are selling so slowly that tours have already been cancelled. INFLATION TRIGGERS CONTRACTION IN REAL SPENDING POWER DESPITE GOOD NOMINAL WAGE GROWTH IN VS.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!6:  Inflationary pressures were unleashed by pandemic-related supply chain challenges, the frictions of a stop-start reopening, vast fiscal stimulus and pent-up consumer savings. The impact of these is being exacerbated by a war on Europes periphery that is creating havoc with commodity markets, especially those for energy, chemicals and basic grains. Calls that inflation and rates were peaking or transitory proved wrong again and again. The rise in inflation has spread beyond volatile commodities into core parts of the economy . Wherever real estate occupational markets have been tight enough to give landlords pricing power, which mercifully is the case in many cities and sectors across the globe, real estate cash flows have benefited from inflation. However, this is a reminder that real estate can act as both a hedge for and a source of inflation. Surges in residential rents and home prices have also contributed to higher inflation. and a bid-ask spread has emerged in many markets, causing a slowdown in transactions .;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, the Ukraine war, inflation and gas crisis have had a negative effect on consumer mood.

Little Consensus beyond Hybrid The future of work is hybrid.

Pro-office voices are growing and companies particularly in the financial sectorare increasingly demanding a full-time return to the office.

Flexible work schedules allow for more housing options, since commuting fewer days per week allows workers to choose housing further from the officea significant benefit when housing costs have hit record levels. The taste of freedom gained during the pandemic will be difficult to take away.

Schumpeters viewpoints were shaped by being an escapee of both the rise of fascism in 1930s Germany and of Soviet-style communism of the 1950sregimes that came to power through sham elections. Like the 2525 video, reading Schumpeter reminds us how the past, present and future all intersect. Geopolitical events in LaSalles target countries are as difficult to predict as the idiosyncratic motivations of their leaders. As researchers, we cannot know the future, but we can help devise strategies to cope with whatever alternative futures may arise. The forces of nationalism, authoritarianism and a distrust of globalism may represent a temporary triumph of politics over economics. Over the long term, though, the power of open markets remains a force to be reckoned with and not to be underestimated. Likewise, well-constructed and well-located properties can thrive even during periods of great political turmoil. Successful real estate investing rests on identification of timeless attributes that are successful over the course of several cycles. These attributes must be appropriately priced and they must also adapt to trends in demographics, technology, urbanization and environmental factors. This triangle of timelessness, adaptation and fair value pricing forms the foundation for successful real estate investing. As I hand over the reins of LaSalles research to a new generation of researchers, I sense that the past, present and future will continue to intersect and to overlap. The awarding of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Economics was based in part on an analysis of the Great Depression of the 1930s. We have learned much about credit cycles and the role of banks in maintaining or losing confidence in market institutions. At the same time, the events of 2022 in Ukraine and elsewhere show how unpredictable the course of human events can be. The semi-predictable path of rising C02 levels is leading to weather volatility along with rising atmospheric and oceanic temperatures.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!8: 4 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021 2023e 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021 2023e LIFE SCIENCES: FOCUS ON HEALTH Research offices are a niche segment, but also a growth market Staying healthy as you age  who wouldnt want that? In simplified terms, this is the motivation driving the booming Life Sciences sector of the economy, which is resear- ching corresponding solutions. However, classic office premises are not appropriate for companies in this segment. Although office space is required for administrative and management functions, the main focus is on laboratory space used by the biolo- gists, chemists and medical staff who are carrying out the research. This combinati- on - the young lab offices segment - is of increasing interest to investors. What lies behind the lab office trend and what potential does it have? The Covid pandemic is a starting point for a review of this segment. It has not only shifted vaccine development into the public focus, but has also brought into the mainstream concepts such as vulnerable and pre-existing conditions to refer to people at risk of serious cases of Covid 19. Because people are living longer thanks to medical progress, these concepts apply to large sections of the population and not just to a small number of people. In 2021 in Germany more than one fifth of the po- pulation  around 18 million people  had reached the age of 65. However, increa- sed life expectancy has not so far been accompanied by improved fitness levels. In fact the opposite is true. A sedentary lifestyle, high-calorie food, ready meals contai- ning a lot of sugar, and the consumption of alcohol and tobacco have consequences, and considerably increase the risk of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, demen- tia, heart attacks, cancer and strokes. The growing number of older people suffering ill health is also a significant economic factor.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!10:  After all, large and growing sections of the populations of the affluent countries of Asia, Europe and North America suffer from these diseases. The willingness and ability to invest large amounts of money in maintaining health is therefore correspondingly strong. An ever increasing number of people worldwide al- so have access to medical care. Life Sciences essentially consist of a combination of various scientific disciplines such as biology, chemistry, medicine and pharmaceuticals. In turn, the main activity of the biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and medical technology segments in focus he- re is research into living organisms. Life Sciences are associated with the develop- ment of economically successful products for human health rather than with funda- mental research. In Germany, biotechnology moved centre stage and gained additi- onal momentum with the approval of the first Covid vaccine. However, the path to producing a market-ready substance is long and fraught with obstacles. Only a fraction of the substances researched are actually successful. To achieve rapid progress, sufficiently large teams are needed. Growth in the number of jobs in Life Sciences is leading to correspondingly higher demand for properties and investment. According to estimates, more than 300,000 people in more than 2,000 companies are employed in the Life Sciences sector in Germany. Biotechnology is the smallest segment, while pharmaceuticals and medical technology employ signifi- cantly more people. The functions of the properties required range from pure offices via laboratories and pharmaceutical logistics to production plants. From our perspec- tive, this combination of office and laboratory  the lab office  is of particular interest to investors.;\n***\n[Submission]: Answer: Yes, the function of the brain is to control and coordinate body activities, interpret information from the senses, and process information from the environment.

Three, constrained construction of new supply, and a price run-up on the single-family for-sale front, spilled over into expanded apartment demand.  Lastly, compounding the effects of these four dramatic imbalances came the rocket fuel of a global capital rotation toward de-risked assets . Outsized demand, a sudden spike in remote work mobility, constricted supply, and floods of money with nowhere better to goa grand slam of anomalies. The U. S. apartment property sectorproviding shelter to 37 mil- lion residents in 21.3 million structures of five or more household units, and contributing $3.4 trillion annually to the U. S. economy, according to the NMHCmorphed quickly into an investment asset class pressure cooker. Inflated property valuations, com- pressed cap rates, and a sea change from individual owners to medium and large-sized corporate owners became a new norm seemingly overnight. This time period veers wildly from a steady slope of otherwise well-entrenched trends across the structural demand front. Operational modernization kicked into super-fast-forward mode toward self-service, and a robust new-development pipeline at least. According to a recent Bloomberg report, After dipping in 2020, the number of new units authorized in multifamily build- ings took off, running 37 percent higher over the past 12 months as of June 2022 than in the same period in 20182019. As of August, 862,000 apartments were under construction, up 25 percent from a year ago. At the same time, COVIDs aftermath sharply defined conflicting forceswhich together destine virtually all of Americas newly developed and built apartment communities for a financially privileged professional class. Rather than causing an expansion of rental housing stock, however, higher-income households come-lately demand for rental neighborhoods instead served to crowd out moderate- and lower-income households in supply- constrained areas. Its been virtually impossible to build affordable, says the chief executive of one of the apartment industry trade groups.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!27: 1 Changes to building codes over the past 10 years Sources: National Association of Home Builders. National Multifamily Housing Council. confidence suggests that that decline will likely continue until the interest rate environment turns more favorable. to a report from economists at the Fed, perhaps a reaction to lockdown claustrophobia. And the homes that do get built are expensive, particularly since the pandemic. Construction costs shot up due to supply chain disruptions and are still worrisome. As one housing industry adviser notes, Theres a stress index about global supply chains, and those stress indices are all indicating that theyre moderating, but theyre still at very high levels. Finally, high permitting fees and utility charges and large minimum lot sizes push developers to build more expensive homes. Renters Priced Out of the Homebuying Market With a growing share of households priced out of the for-sale market, demand for rental units is far outstripping new supply. Though population growth slowed sharply during the pandemic, demand is also rising from the many young adults eager to start their own households after moving back in with their parents during COVID. Further boosting demand is the increasing number of younger adults choosing to live alone, according The multifamily sector has responded with an unprecedented increase in new supply. Weve built more multifamily housing units over the last 10 years than we had in any other time since 1980, notes an adviser to institutional investors. But it is still far less than needed. Vacancies have fallen to their lowest levels ever while rents are rising faster than evereven faster than home prices. And though not a formal part of the affordability calculations, other housing-related costs like utilities and main- tenance are also rising faster than incomes, further constraining the ability of households to afford basic shelter. Moving to More Affordable Recent slowdowns in rent growth and home price appreciation, noted in our Normalizing trend, have done little to increase affordability. So how to address this? Millions of people have taken matters into their own hands.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!66:  Today, with more than one out of three of Americas 44 million renter households earning less than $36,000 a year, roughly every other rental household puts more than 30 percent of their earnings toward rent. And one out of every four households spends 50 percent or more of their wages on housing. Those percentages reflect divides that deepen because not enough new apartment units are coming online. A present that is polarized grows more so over time. For market- rate property investors, developers, owners, and managers, what lies ahead is the brightest beacon of prosperity. But for those who live and reside below the cutline of wherewithal and social mobility, the future of apartment rentals holds more ques- tions than answers. With 1.3 million new U. S. households projected each year through 2035, apartment industry trade groupsthe National Multifamily Housing Council (NMHC) and the National Apartment Associationcalculate that the United States needs 4.3 million newly built apartments between now and then. That level of new development would work out to 331,000 new multifamily rental units annually. This would expand the exist- ing apartment rental stock in the United States by more than 20 percent in just over a decade. What makes this goal plausible are two strong tailwinds: household demographics and an unprecedented global embrace of apartment development by the investment community. Still, the throes of land use policy drag on development. But beyond local policy barriers, tugging housing to its future, are a trio of macro forcesworklife balance, an urgency to stall the climate effects of global warming, and an array of technolo- giesin business management, livability, and construction. Can this darling of real estate asset classes sustain its hold on global investment inflows, unleash constructions modern manu- facturing era, turn the tide on local political will, and win over the hearts, minds, and pocketbooks of consumer households to pull off such a feat? If you had to guess todaywith residential rental vacancies at historical lows of 6.2 percent and occupancy rates and median asking rents for vacant units at historical highsthe answer would be a cautious yes.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!67:  However, a gigantic hurdle stands in the way of telling fleet- ing trends apart from ones that will last: the pandemic and its aftermath.

Frankfurt is a strong retail location with its two prime locations Zeil and Goethestrae as well as several large shopping centres. Another plus point is the fairly moderate decline in prime rents given the negative conditions. By the end of 2021 they had fallen by around 8 per cent to EUR 275 per m2 and have since remained unchanged. Plans for the City of Frankfurt to play an active role in the development of the city centre - some of which is not very attractive - are also positive. A total of EUR 30m is to be invested in city centre projects, with the aim of upgrading the quality of stay. How- ever, retail is also playing a role here. For example, the Galeria store at the entrance to the Zeil has been remodelled into the Weltstadthaus and has been visibly upgraded while remaining open. The former sports arena building which is also close to the Hauptwache is being demolished and will be replaced by 2024 by a modern commercial building with offices.

Furthermore, with revenue expectations muted, a greater proportion of respondents (33) are planning to cut costs compared to last year, when just 6 planned to make cuts. A RECENT DELOITTE ECONOMICS report offered several scenarios for the near-term outlook in the United States.2 The most likely scenario is that economic growth continues through 2022, though tightening monetary policy, peaking employment growth, and continued energy and food shortages slow this near-term growth trajectory. Inflation would remain high through 2022, but gradually settle around 2 by mid-2023 as demand for goods subsides in favor of services, helping businesses alleviate supply chain issues. The Federal Reserve would raise rates to combat inflation through 2022, but slow rate increases as inflation normalizes. Other, less likely scenarios include: (1) Back to the 1970s (25) where businesses raise prices and wages in lockstep and there is sustained high inflation. (2) COVID-19 relapse (5) in which vaccines become ineffective, and lockdowns are again imposed. And (3) Next recession (15), triggered by overly aggressive tightening of monetary policy as governments attempt to tame inflation. Regardless of which scenario comes to fruition, the 2023 Deloitte real estate outlook survey reveals that concerns about the economy are top of mind for most global real estate leaders as they prepare for the remainder of 2022 and 2023 . Revenue expectations for the full year are mixed among those surveyed, and generally more muted than last year.

At a minimum, it has been the rebound that many had hoped for. At best, it has been something of a renaissance after two very challenging years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Rent Growth and Occupancy Levels Not Seen in at Least a Decade Heading into the final month of the fall 2022 leasing season, both rent growth and occupancy sit at all-time highs. The former sits right at 6 percentalmost three times greater than the 2010s decade normwhile the latter clocks in above 90 percentplus. That is the earliest the sector has ever crested above that 90 percent threshold on record. By the semesters start, it is almost a foregone conclusion that the year will kick off with never-before-seen occupancy rates. With student competitive housing also seeing record rent growth and occupancy rates as well, there is less pressure on purpose-built off- campus housing space than in years past. Investment from Institutional Players Solidifies Student Housing as a CRE Sector Back in 2018, there was a big splash in the student housing space when Greystar completed its acquisition of EDR. At the time of acquisition, that left only one publicly traded real estate investment trust (REIT) in the student housing space. Yet another massive announcement followed in 2022 with Blackstones acquisition of American Campus Communities, which closed in early August. Although the acquisition leaves no publicly traded REITs in the sectora development that lends itself to some challenges in terms of reporting and benchmarkingthe more important takeaway is that institu- tional capital continues to flow into the sector. Will Fall 2022 Be a Flash-in-the-Pan Rebound, or a Positive Shift in Long-Term Expectations? While somewhat more difficult to measure, the return to a more normal campus life for students, university employees, and industry professionals alike has been widely welcomed. After all, record leasing activity and record rent growth indirectly point to improved qualitative aspects of student life such as on-campus activities and in-person classes.;\n\nreal_estate_index:bouwinvest_international-market-outlook_2023-2025-1.pdf-!5:  Broker reports indicate that prime yields already started to move out in some locations between Q1 2022 and Q2 2022, with German cities leading the pack at 30bps. French and Spanish cities posted quarter-on-quarter yield increases of between 15 and 25bps. As risk-free rates are up and expected to remain elevated between 2023 and 2025, we believe office capital values could soften further during the outlook period, and we estimate prime yields in Europe will move out by another 50bps. This would amount to a value loss of around 10 to 15 before stabilization and recovery takes place. Office transaction volumes in Europe already fell by over 20 during Q2 2022 compared with the same year-earlier period. Bouwinvest Outlook 2023-2025 9 Europe Logistics Covid-19 had a surprisingly positive effect on European logistics markets with the accelerated adoption of online shopping more than offsetting the economic turmoil. Now that the pandemic appears to be largely under control, the pace of e-commerce growth has eased, but is still positive and the potential for further expansion remains strong as consumers service expectations continue to evolve and drive demand for logistics properties. reluctance among municipalities to issue land for new logistic space. We expect this latter trend to continue in the coming years, with Germany and France currently showing the most resistance to new greenfield developments. As a result, nominal rental growth, although slowing down, is expected to remain positive during the outlook period at a figure just shy of 3.0 per annum. Global supply chain disruption following the pandemic and ongoing geopolitical tensions are also fuelling a supply chain reconfiguration with a greater emphasis on onshoring over just-in-time. This is boosting domestic demand for logistics real estate and helping to ease wider supply chain pressures. European economic support programmes running until 2027 and totalling 1.1 trillion are expected to provide another boost to the sector.

In Japan, yield curve control comes at the cost of a weak yen. If the Bank of Japan (BoJ) remains committed to keeping interest rates near zero, currency intervention, such as yen-buying to prevent further depreciation, could be on the table again. However, currency intervention has rarely been successful absent the cooperation from other central banks. Any changes to the yield control approach are likely to come after BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kurodas term concludes in April 2023. Nonetheless, most of the challenges Japan is facing are externally driven, while domestic-driven fundamentals remain relatively healthy. Australia, South Korea and Singapore are the most directly impacted by rising interest rates in the West. The outlook of these economies is likely to follow AP.1 Diverging monetary policies in Asia Pacific the trends in the West, albeit to varying degrees. The Monetary Authority of Singapore manages monetary policies through the foreign exchange markets, given that for a small and open economy, the exchange rate has a much stronger influence on inflation than the interest rate. That said, the magnitude of interest rate hikes in Singapore has been less than that of the US. Additionally, an increasing number of firms are pivoting to Singapore for their regional headquarters due to its geopolitical stability. All of these are adding to the relative strength of Singapores economy. The weakness of Asia Pacific currencies is mostly a story of US dollar strength. Nevertheless, uncertainties over the macro outlook and the dispersion among regional economies could lead to the continuing divergence of real estate market performance in the next 12-24 months.

Will the downturn be steep or shallow? Long or short in duration?  Longer term, will inflation become endemic, remaining sticky at a higher level than observed in recent decades? There are reasons for optimism. Labor markets across developed economies are in almost universally good health. Some of the initial triggers of this inflationary episode, such as supply chain pressures, seem to be resolving. Household and corporate balance sheets are reasonably healthy, although income statements are being hit by higher debt service costs wherever borrowing costs are not fixed. The typical culprit for a prolonged economic downturn is a balance sheet recession, as during the Global Financial Crisis, but the conditions for such a prolonged slump do not appear to be met in most segments of the global economy. Real estate fundamentals remain healthy and vacancy rates are low across many property sectors. Meanwhile, expectations for subdued long-run inflation remain in place, with long-run breakeven inflation rates implied by the market suggesting only a moderate increase from prior levels n o z i r o h r a e y - 0 1 r e v O ( 3.5 3.0 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 -0.;\n\nreal_estate_index:bouwinvest_international-market-outlook_2023-2025-1.pdf-!8:  The country remains politically divided after the mid-term elections in November 2022 and polarisation is increasing, leading to potentially volatile policy making.

Both also enter 2023 with economies that are still growing and real estate fundamentals largely in balance. There are challenges, but the medium- to long-term outlook remains brighter than the outlook for the near-term. Real estate investors need strategies that are resilient to an expected volatile environment in 2023 and take advantage of the opportunities emerging from volatility. Stubbornly high inflation The root cause of market challenges heading into 2023 is elevated inflation. The US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada have both made lowering inflation their top priority, but it remains stubbornly high in both markets. This led to policy rates increasing from effectively zero to over four percent by year end. The increase in policy rates has been mirrored in long-term rates and in real estate borrowing rates. The impact has been a dramatic shift in the direction of property values, from a rapid rise in 2021 and early 2022, to a fall in the second half of 2022.

Three, constrained construction of new supply, and a price run-up on the single-family for-sale front, spilled over into expanded apartment demand.  Lastly, compounding the effects of these four dramatic imbalances came the rocket fuel of a global capital rotation toward de-risked assets . Outsized demand, a sudden spike in remote work mobility, constricted supply, and floods of money with nowhere better to goa grand slam of anomalies. The U. S. apartment property sectorproviding shelter to 37 mil- lion residents in 21.3 million structures of five or more household units, and contributing $3.4 trillion annually to the U. S. economy, according to the NMHCmorphed quickly into an investment asset class pressure cooker. Inflated property valuations, com- pressed cap rates, and a sea change from individual owners to medium and large-sized corporate owners became a new norm seemingly overnight. This time period veers wildly from a steady slope of otherwise well-entrenched trends across the structural demand front. Operational modernization kicked into super-fast-forward mode toward self-service, and a robust new-development pipeline at least.

Some trends are well known while others are developing. In 2022 and into 2023, senior housing trends include the following: 1. The growth of the sector into new product types differenti- ated by rate and service offerings as the sector continues to mature and evolve. 2. The articulation of a new value proposition for senior hous- ing as the proverbial fountain of youth for future baby boomer residents who seek a high quality of life, wellness, longevity, and a sense of purpose. 3. The recognition that senior housing is truly part of the health care continuum. 4. The gradual recovery of occupancy from the nadir reached during COVID-19, boosted by a recent slowdown in inven- tory growth and strong post-pandemic demand patterns. 5. Outside exogenous factors including the national and global economies, inflation, and rising interest rates, which present new challenges for senior housing. 6.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!67:  However, a gigantic hurdle stands in the way of telling fleet- ing trends apart from ones that will last: the pandemic and its aftermath.

The Pandemic: This Time Is Different With the pandemic and the cascade of economic and social policies it set off, five macro apartment industry tailwinds reached gale-force levels:  One, there was a preexisting multigenerational avalanche of both rent-by-choice and rent-by-necessity demand for multifamily rental units.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!65:  Note: Based on U. S. respondents only. Beyond the major property types, 2023 may be known as the year that niche property types came into their own. Five of the six highest-rated property subtypes would be considered niche, led by workforce housing and data centers, as well as life-sci- ences facilities, medical office, and single-family rental housing. These sectors generally command greater returns than tradi- tional product types due to higher cap rates. But investors also value the strong demographic tailwinds supporting these niche sectors at a time of expectations of cyclical market challenges. Multifamily: A Bumpy Ride and a Bumper Crop  Demographics: A four-generation surge of household formation and housing preference will buoy fundamental apartment demand through and beyond 2030.  Technology impact: Exponential advances in technology, data, and artificial intelligence capability and applications will have impacts on building-cycle, property operations and management, and resident experience cost-versus-value models.  Capital liquidity: A post-pandemic-era flight to safety will continue to divert yield-seeking capital into residential rental real estate vehicles.  Policy constraint: Policymakers ever more restrictive land use barriers will spread sharper supply-versus-demand mismatches to more cities, straining market-based solutions and sculpting evolving geographies as people seek refuge from high-cost locales.

Investors should be patient but prepared to act as opportunities materialize. In the meantime, floating rate debt investment at defensive loan-to-value ratios represents an attractive strategy. Debt re- pricing is nearly instantaneous, while equity re-pricing takes time.  The equilibrium state of monetary policy will require more private capital to participate in the construction of productivity-enhancing infrastructure, such as life sciences facilities, logistics and decarbonizing the value chain. Governments can ill afford another lost decade, but neither can they borrow at scale to finance large infrastructure spending.  Focus on a narrower group of cities, rich in human capital, which will do better economically thanks to tech-heavy industries and services, light manufacturing and tourism. This is not confined only to large cities but includes stand-out secondary markets such as Bristol in the UK and a range of innovative university cities.  Prospects for income growth will be strongest for the best-located assets of a given type for example, offices in vibrant mixed-use zones or logistics assets on crossroads of multiple trans-modal routesand for assets with strong green credentials.

Flight-to-quality has been the primary demand driver in major office markets, particularly in Australia and Japan. Tenants continue to favor high-quality offices in locations with strong work-live-play attributes . In addition, sustainability credentials are increasingly essential for tenants and lenders, particularly in Australia and Singapore. We therefore expect the dispersion of office performance to widen, even for assets within the same submarket. In 2023, we expect office markets with diversified tenant bases, low vacancies and limited supply pipelines to outperform. Singapore leads in LaSalles Asia Pacific Office Target Market Analysis, which ranks the outlook of major office markets in the region over the next three years. Tokyo remains highly ranked among major office markets, primarily due to its low vacancy rates, although some upward pressure on vacancies and downward pressure on rents are expected in Tokyo as supply increases over the next two to three years. The Sydney and Melbourne office markets are well positioned within Australia but are expected to remain weak by their historical standards, while the Shanghai office market could take time to recover. Micro-location selection will be more important than before the pandemic, as office performance widens in the region.

French and Spanish cities posted quarter-on-quarter yield increases of between 15 and 25bps. As risk-free rates are up and expected to remain elevated between 2023 and 2025, we believe office capital values could soften further during the outlook period, and we estimate prime yields in Europe will move out by another 50bps. This would amount to a value loss of around 10 to 15 before stabilization and recovery takes place. Office transaction volumes in Europe already fell by over 20 during Q2 2022 compared with the same year-earlier period. Bouwinvest Outlook 2023-2025 9 Europe Logistics Covid-19 had a surprisingly positive effect on European logistics markets with the accelerated adoption of online shopping more than offsetting the economic turmoil. Now that the pandemic appears to be largely under control, the pace of e-commerce growth has eased, but is still positive and the potential for further expansion remains strong as consumers service expectations continue to evolve and drive demand for logistics properties. reluctance among municipalities to issue land for new logistic space. We expect this latter trend to continue in the coming years, with Germany and France currently showing the most resistance to new greenfield developments. As a result, nominal rental growth, although slowing down, is expected to remain positive during the outlook period at a figure just shy of 3.0 per annum. Global supply chain disruption following the pandemic and ongoing geopolitical tensions are also fuelling a supply chain reconfiguration with a greater emphasis on onshoring over just-in-time. This is boosting domestic demand for logistics real estate and helping to ease wider supply chain pressures. European economic support programmes running until 2027 and totalling 1.1 trillion are expected to provide another boost to the sector.

Inflation should eventually settle closer to central banks target levels, allowing the longed-for pivot in interest rates. Bid-ask spreads in real estate capital markets will narrow, allowing activity to resume at an adjusted pricing level.

To reduce the number of visible vacant properties, the Hamburg Senate has established a funding programme to enable creative businesses and start-ups to temporarily rent unused retail space. By the end of 2022 Karstadt Sport will accordingly become an Artstadt. In summer and autumn 2022, the former Kaufhof store is also being used for an exhibition by the street artist Banksy. However, the long-term use of the two department stores remains unde- cided. A new building with bars and restaurants, a hotel and offices and trade on the ground floor and first floor is also being constructed in Mnckebergstrae to replace the CA store. A shopping centre with sales space of around 80,000 m2 in the Ha- fenCity due for completion in 2024 could represent a headwind for the city centre with its sales space of around 350,000 m2.

In response to the now lower demand for sales space, Gerber will be converted to a mixed use quarter by 2023. Further building plans in the city centre relate to the new construction of office and retail space to replace the former sports arena (Knig-Schulstrae) and the new Bundesbank building on the former Kaufhof site (Eberhardstrae). The con- verted Sport-Scheck will open at the beginning of the autumn as a pilot branch with a completely new concept over four floors.

At a minimum, it has been the rebound that many had hoped for. At best, it has been something of a renaissance after two very challenging years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Rent Growth and Occupancy Levels Not Seen in at Least a Decade Heading into the final month of the fall 2022 leasing season, both rent growth and occupancy sit at all-time highs. The former sits right at 6 percentalmost three times greater than the 2010s decade normwhile the latter clocks in above 90 percentplus. That is the earliest the sector has ever crested above that 90 percent threshold on record. By the semesters start, it is almost a foregone conclusion that the year will kick off with never-before-seen occupancy rates. With student competitive housing also seeing record rent growth and occupancy rates as well, there is less pressure on purpose-built off- campus housing space than in years past. Investment from Institutional Players Solidifies Student Housing as a CRE Sector Back in 2018, there was a big splash in the student housing space when Greystar completed its acquisition of EDR. At the time of acquisition, that left only one publicly traded real estate investment trust (REIT) in the student housing space. Yet another massive announcement followed in 2022 with Blackstones acquisition of American Campus Communities, which closed in early August. Although the acquisition leaves no publicly traded REITs in the sectora development that lends itself to some challenges in terms of reporting and benchmarkingthe more important takeaway is that institu- tional capital continues to flow into the sector. Will Fall 2022 Be a Flash-in-the-Pan Rebound, or a Positive Shift in Long-Term Expectations? While somewhat more difficult to measure, the return to a more normal campus life for students, university employees, and industry professionals alike has been widely welcomed. After all, record leasing activity and record rent growth indirectly point to improved qualitative aspects of student life such as on-campus activities and in-person classes.;\n\nreal_estate_index:outlook-real-estatet-market-germany-dec-2022.pdf-!13:  From the point of view of most occupiers, space will therefore remain scarce and expensive, especially since the initially still high inflation will eat up any savings in cold rent through higher costs elsewhere. In view of this dynamic, risk-taking investors and those for whom real estate is an investment that needs to be actively managed are likely to get their moneys worth in 2023. Asset management could become the buzzword of the year. In view of the major trends of digitalisation and decarbonisation, it could well be not just a year, but an era of asset management. But that is a topic for another outlook. Conclusion Despite all the uncertainty, one thing seems certain in our view for the real estate year 2023: it will remain challenging for all market players. Investors will be busy digesting the interest rate turnaround for at least the first few months. And many occupiers will increasingly feel the effects of the economic downturn. Letting-related issues will thus also come more to the fore for landlords in the course of the year. However, not only cyclical but also structural changes will keep the market in motion. Especially in terms of the occupier markets for office and retail spaces, this can be summed up in the formula size down and grade up. This creates both abundance and scarcity: abundance of space that no longer meets the increased demands and scarcity of those spaces that do. In many cases, however, even the surplus areas are not fundamentally obsolete. Often it is only a matter of identifying a suitable subsequent use and preparing the land for it. There are numerous opportunities for this, because supply remains scarce in many other market en. savills. deresearch 9 Savills Team Please contact us for further information Marcus Lemli CEO Germany 49 (0) 69 273 000 12 mlemlisavills. de Panajotis Aspiotis Agency 49 (0) 221 22 962 220 paspiotissavills. de Karsten Nemecek Corp.

Cologne is also bottom of the league along with Stuttgart for prime rents with a figure of EUR 26 per m2 respectively. In the case of Cologne, this is likely also to relate to the fact that the public sector accounts for a large part of the demand for office space. However, after a long period of stagnation, prime rents in Cologne put in a stronger rise from 2018 onwards. As in the other office markets, this reflected a very meagre supply. In spite of growing white-collar employment, the volume of new space remained moderate. The Covid-led decline in letting activity was mostly concentrated in 2020. There was already a strong rise in take-up last year to a high level of slightly over 300,000 m2. This year's take-up could even exceed this figure since take-up in the first half had reached the previous high at around 210,000 m2. Of this, the public sector accounted for almost half  BiMA and the Cologne City Council have leased over 80,000 m2 in two transactions. Cologne is currently the only city among the top locations with a vacancy rate of under 3 per cent, i. e. only marginally above the pre-Covid level. The limited availability of space is likely to mitigate the dampening effect of weak eco- nomic conditions.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!57:  VACANCY RATE IN 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 2002 OFFICE SPACE COMPLETIONS IN COLOGNE IN M 300,000 250,000 200,000 150,000 100,000 50,000 Source: bulwiengesa Cologne: Office space PRIME OFFICE RENT IN EUR PER M 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 2005 Cologne TAKE-UP IN COLOGNE IN M 450,000 400,000 350,000 300,000 250,000 200,000 150,000 100,000 50,000 0 Source: bulwiengesa 2003 2006 2009 second half year 2012 2015 2018 first half year 2021 0 1992 1997 Cologne 2002 2007 2012 2017 2022e average 1992-2021 35 36 Dsseldorf: Office space PRIME OFFICE RENT IN EUR PER M 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 2002 2008 2005 Dsseldorf VACANCY RATE () 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 2011 2014 2017 2020 2023e Top-7 Regional-12 2002 2008 2005 Dsseldorf 2011 2014 2017 2020 2023e Top-7 Regional-12 Source: bulwiengesa, DZ BANK forecast High level of vacancies slowing down rent rises Source: bulwiengesa, DZ BANK forecast Dsseldorf has the smallest office market among the top locations , although it only lags marginally behind Cologne and Stuttgart.

However, tourism was not quite as important before Covid as in other top locations. Spending power is also moderate for a top location at 104 points. Unlike Dsseldorf with its distinctive luxury segment, Cologne city centre is focused on lower-end retail. A three kilometre shopping circuit encourages a stroll through prime locations and boosts footfall. One particular example is Schildergasse, the location for many chain store branches. Footfall is also high in Hohe Strae, but below the high levels of Schildergasse. Conversely, Ehrenstrae is a trendy location. A smaller luxury segment has become established in the DomklosterWallrafplatz area. The consequences of the pandemic have clearly had an impact on Cologne ci- ty centre. Between 2019 and the end of 2021 prime rents fell by 12 per cent to EUR 225 per m2, a level which has since been maintained. The rate of decline is on a par with the trend in the top locations, and the relatively large supply of sales space in Cologne city centre has not therefore had any further negative impact on the rent trend. No new information is available on plans announced in spring 2022 to demo- lish the building where the Galeria branch is located in Breiten Strae.

These include large catchment areas of several million people each, high visitor numbers from Germany and abroad, high footfall, and  with the exception of Berlin and Cologne  high spending power. In addition to this is a broad shopping of- fer, both in city centre shopping streets and in shopping centres which are often still new. Many years of strong demographic growth has also played a part so far, boosting customer potential from year to year. However, the populations of the top locations contracted slightly overall in 2020 and 2021. An ongoing decline is never- theless fairly unlikely. Population numbers will presumably continue to grow.

However, the trend has varied widely from one city to another among the top seven. Take-up in Dsseldorf and above all in Frankfurt was rather low. Whereas the level in Berlin and Munich was roughly back in line with for- mer average figures, it was slightly above in Hamburg and well above in Cologne and Stuttgart. In 2022, after a Covid-led period of weakness, huge interest in new office concepts and modern space in buildings which are as sustainable as possible has led to a sharp rise in prime rents. Prime rents have risen by an average of between just over 4 per cent and over 8 per cent in Berlin and Stuttgart against mid- 2021. At the half-way stage, prime rents ranged from EUR 26 per m2 in Cologne and Stuttgart to EUR 44 per m2 in Frankfurt. The figure in Berlin and Munich is only mar- ginally lower.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!49:  New space will also be needed if offices are to be merged. To that extent, surplus space will only gradually be made available in future. This space could remain available in the market, which might lead to a rise in vacan- cies, or, alternatively, office buildings which are no longer economically viable for letting could be pulled down or repurposed. Comparison of office markets in top locations There was little sign of any crisis in the top locations' office markets in the first half. The Covid-led dip in take-up has been largely ironed out by a bounce-back in de- mand for office space since the end of 2021. Take-up in Q2 2022 rose to over 1 mil- lion m2  a figure only exceeded seven times in the 50 quarters since 2010. The ear- lier uptick in vacancies has been brought to a halt by an increase in letting activity. Overall, the vacancy rate rose by 1.5 percentage points to around 4.5 per cent on the back of the pandemic, but as such remains fairly low. Whereas there was a more pronounced variation in the vacancy rate between the seven top locations in the past, two camps have now emerged. At 8 per cent, the vacancy rate in Dsseldorf and Frankfurt is roughly twice that of the five other loca- tions which have figures of 3 to 4 per cent. Prior to Covid, Berlin, Munich and Stuttgart had the lowest vacancy rates. Most recently, though, they have been beat- en by Cologne with a figure of 2.8 per cent.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!58:  However, the momentum of rental rises clearly lagged behind the trend among the top locations. One of the main rea- sons for this is likely to have been a fairly high vacancy rate  as in Frankfurt  at just under 8 per cent. However, the vacancies mostly involve older office space which is often only marketable to a limited extent. Take-up in the first half of 2022 was around 160,000 m2, slightly less than in previous years. This included two larger lettings  17,500 m2 for the Volkshochschule and 15,000 m2 for Ernst Young. These transactions are also a reflection of the most important ten- ants in the first half, since public sector bodies and consultancies each accounted for roughly one quarter of total take-up. After a higher level of brand-new space coming onto the market in 2020 and 2021 than in previous years, less new space is ex- pected this year and next year, which should slow down the rise in prime rents. The trend in prime rents could be slightly weaker in Dsseldorf than in the other top loca- tions, reflecting not only headwind from the energy crisis and the threat of recession but also quite a high vacancy level.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!28:  19 AVAILABILITY OF SALES SPACE STILL GOOD IN ALL TOP LOCATIONS AVAILABILITY RATIO IN BASED ON CATCHMENT AREAS, ALL TOP LOCATIONS ARE CITIES OF MILLIONS SIZE OF CATCHMENT AREA IN MILLION PEOPLE (2020) 26 17 13 15 10 19 18 16 16 16 17 16 14 10 Berlin Dussel- dorf Frank- furt Hamburg Cologne Munich Stuttgart by numer of shops by retail space Source: JLL 5.4 3.5 3.2 2.4 2.4 2.6 2.0 Cologne Stuttgart Munich Hamburg Berlin Dussel- dorf Frank- furt Source: Comfort Complete package of top locations still convincing The positive trend in retail space rental and the halt to the downward rent trend are based on the generally attractive package which the seven largest cities offer to retailers.

After more than a decade of lower for longer, the Fed is finally normalizing interest rates closer to historical levels. Those rising interest rates are already driving up debt costs and thus the costs to acquire and develop property, reducing leveraged returns. At the same time, the federal government is done with providing stimulus, indirectly reducing tenant demand for space. Unlike in the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and during the pandemic, nobodys coming to the rescue, and now we got to take our medicine, and here it comes, says the head of research for an investment management firm. Thus, the government is turning off both the monetary and fiscal spigots that had been support- ing commercial real estate and the economy overall. The head of a development company summarized it like this: I feel like weve been on a little bit of a sugar high with this stimu- lus and cheap debt. Theres going to be a slowdown. Theres got to be this normalization. So, what does that mean? I think its going to be a little bouncy. Its going to be a little bit turbulent. But then we bottom out, and we start back into growth. 2.  Still, Weve Changed Some  The pandemic forced structural shifts in how and where we live, work, and recreate in ways that seem destinated to endure.  Online spending is receding from its pandemic peaks but is not likely to revert to pre-pandemic levels. Business travel is unlikely to recover to pre-COVID levels for at least several years, meaning business hotels, fine dining, and conference facilities will continue to face challenges.  The greatest changes may be in how and where we work. The impact on office use and leasing is still evolving, and a significant share of the existing stock may need to be reposi- tioned to remain competitive.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!9:  Defying just about every prediction voiced during the terrifying and uncertain days of the COVID lockdown that began in March 2020, U. S. commercial property markets actually embarked on a remarkable run, with some of the strongest returns, rent growth, and price appreciation rates ever recorded. Not every property type, however: hotels endured their worst and most sustained downturn in memory, while offices suffered an unprecedented and significant cut in usage of space. And not every market: some of the nations strongest gateway mar- kets, like New York City and San Francisco, experienced sharp outflows of residents, businesses, and tenants of all types. But overall and across much of the United States, property markets far outperformed expectations and historical norms. And now, more than two years on, property investors and managers are learning anew that whopping growth and profits eventually fall back to eartha reversion to the mean, to use finance jargon, or simply normalizing, as numerous industry experts we interviewed put it. Some looming market adjustments will be cyclical due to the weakening economic conditions that most economists and real estate professionals expect, while others represent more of a return to normalcy after all the pandemic-fueled market distortions. These market reversions will take several forms: prices of most assets are declining as cap rates rise and transaction volumes fall from record levels, while rent gains for others are merely moderating as demand returns to more sustainable levels. Perhaps the biggest surprise is that these reversals of fortune are hitting favored property sectors like multifamily and indus- trial. That does not necessarily mean the market corrections will be painful. In many cases, recent losses in property value will only trim already healthy gains. But many indicators suggest that the (really) good times may be over, at least for a while. Housing Set to Cool A finance executive with one national homebuilder told us, Were still selling. Its just not at the pace that it was selling before the last two years, which was a pace that you dont typi- cally see. So, the markets are more normalizing.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!8:  These conditions would be problematic for property markets: slowing or falling economic growth dampens tenant demand, while higher interest rates raise the cost of developing or acquiring properties. Both factors would cut returns and reduce values. Indeed, rising interest rates and uncertainty over future market conditions are already killing deals since sellers have not been ready to capitulate to buyers growing demands for price concessions, as we discuss in our capital markets trend. New Horizons Still, not all recessions are alike, and most economists, as well as Emerging Trends interviewees, expect any recession to be relatively short and shallow. Reflecting the view of several CRE leaders we interviewed, a senior executive with a global devel- opment and investment firm said, My gut says were going to have a recession, but its going to be relatively mild compared to some of the more severe recessions weve had. I dont see anything like the 2008 economic downturn going on. One leading CRE economist went so far as to say, I think were going into what I would say is a healthy down cycle. Its a cleansing, Schumpeterian idea that every so often, economies property markets includedneed to cleanse, and it washes out bad ideas, it washes out unrealistic unsustainable values. That reset presents new opportunities, even as it introduces uncertainty. Says the CEO of a development company, I think this is a moment in time. And when I look back historically, and I did not act in these moments in time, Ive always regretted it. The 10 emerging trends that we expect for 2023 and beyond follow: 1. Normalizing  Property market fundamentals are normalizing as some markets weaken due to diminishing pandemic tailwinds and the potential for a cyclical economic downturn. Exhibit 1-3 Importance of Issues for Real Estate in 2023 1 No importance 3 Moderate importance 5 Great importance  Some property sectors may cool, including residential and industrial, while others may heat up to historical average levels, such as hotels and retail.  Returns and prices of most assets are declining as cap rates rise and transaction volumes fall from record levels, while rent gains for others are merely moderating as demand returns to a more sustainable pace.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!19:  One of our key themes last year was Everyone Wants In, reflecting the deep and wide investor demand for just about every type of real estate, except central business district (CBD) office and regional malls. Sales volumes jumped to over $800 billion in 2021, according to MSCI Real Assetsalmost double the depressed total in the first pandemic year of 2020 and nearly one-third more than the prior $600 billion record reached in 2019. The surge continued into 2022, with sales volumes in the first half of the year up 38 percent over the same period last year, as even the sharp rise in interest rates did little to dampen transaction volumes. But these recent volumes do not tell the whole storyand the story they do tell may be misleading as to where property markets seem to be heading. Discussions with numerous participants from all corners of the industry confirm that many investors have moved to the sidelinesor to other types of assets like equities and bonds. Indeed, the recent surge may well reflect a last gasp to get deals done before the expected increase in interest rates. Fewer Investors Fewer investors and lenders will be providing capital for assets, according to this years Emerging Trends survey: expectations of availability declined for every one of the 13 equity and debt capital sources. Over the past decade, CRE markets benefited from a substantial capital inflow as alternative investment classes have gained wider acceptance and real estate offered compel- ling risk-adjusted returns. Now, some of those inflows look to reverse. Investor interest is still healthy, but not what it was. Instead of seven or 10 competing offers for sale, theres now two or three, which I think thats normal, says the head of an investment firm. Thats normalizing, too. Several forces look to restrict investor demand, starting with the lower expected returns discussed in our Normalizing trend. Rising interest rates are making acquisition and construc- tion debt more expensive, just when operating incomes seem destined to slide as the economy weakens in the forecasted downturn. Indeed, the prospect of lower income and higher costs is breaking deals, as buyers either seek price breaks or pull out altogether.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, both sources are in agreement that the markets are normalizing.\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

And one out of every four households spends 50 percent or more of their wages on housing. Those percentages reflect divides that deepen because not enough new apartment units are coming online. A present that is polarized grows more so over time. For market- rate property investors, developers, owners, and managers, what lies ahead is the brightest beacon of prosperity. But for those who live and reside below the cutline of wherewithal and social mobility, the future of apartment rentals holds more ques- tions than answers. With 1.3 million new U. S. households projected each year through 2035, apartment industry trade groupsthe National Multifamily Housing Council (NMHC) and the National Apartment Associationcalculate that the United States needs 4.3 million newly built apartments between now and then. That level of new development would work out to 331,000 new multifamily rental units annually. This would expand the exist- ing apartment rental stock in the United States by more than 20 percent in just over a decade. What makes this goal plausible are two strong tailwinds: household demographics and an unprecedented global embrace of apartment development by the investment community. Still, the throes of land use policy drag on development. But beyond local policy barriers, tugging housing to its future, are a trio of macro forcesworklife balance, an urgency to stall the climate effects of global warming, and an array of technolo- giesin business management, livability, and construction. Can this darling of real estate asset classes sustain its hold on global investment inflows, unleash constructions modern manu- facturing era, turn the tide on local political will, and win over the hearts, minds, and pocketbooks of consumer households to pull off such a feat? If you had to guess todaywith residential rental vacancies at historical lows of 6.2 percent and occupancy rates and median asking rents for vacant units at historical highsthe answer would be a cautious yes.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!68:   Two, demand gathered speed and sweep as people sought larger living spaces to balance remote work and household life, and more outdoor living options.  Three, constrained construction of new supply, and a price run-up on the single-family for-sale front, spilled over into expanded apartment demand.  Lastly, compounding the effects of these four dramatic imbalances came the rocket fuel of a global capital rotation toward de-risked assets . Outsized demand, a sudden spike in remote work mobility, constricted supply, and floods of money with nowhere better to goa grand slam of anomalies. The U. S. apartment property sectorproviding shelter to 37 mil- lion residents in 21.3 million structures of five or more household units, and contributing $3.4 trillion annually to the U. S. economy, according to the NMHCmorphed quickly into an investment asset class pressure cooker. Inflated property valuations, com- pressed cap rates, and a sea change from individual owners to medium and large-sized corporate owners became a new norm seemingly overnight. This time period veers wildly from a steady slope of otherwise well-entrenched trends across the structural demand front. Operational modernization kicked into super-fast-forward mode toward self-service, and a robust new-development pipeline at least. According to a recent Bloomberg report, After dipping in 2020, the number of new units authorized in multifamily build- ings took off, running 37 percent higher over the past 12 months as of June 2022 than in the same period in 20182019. As of August, 862,000 apartments were under construction, up 25 percent from a year ago. At the same time, COVIDs aftermath sharply defined conflicting forceswhich together destine virtually all of Americas newly developed and built apartment communities for a financially privileged professional class. Rather than causing an expansion of rental housing stock, however, higher-income households come-lately demand for rental neighborhoods instead served to crowd out moderate- and lower-income households in supply- constrained areas. Its been virtually impossible to build affordable, says the chief executive of one of the apartment industry trade groups.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!156: 5 0.7 0.9 1.1 0.9 1.1 2.1 0.8 1.0 0.9 1.1 0.9 1.0 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.8 1.2 1.1 0.9 0.7 0.9 1.0 0.9 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.1 0.6 0.8 1.1 1.3 0.9 87 Households 5-year projected annual change of owner- occupant households 2023 total Single-family market metrics of all homes likely affordable to 4-person family earning 120 of AMI Tenure cost proportion (ownrent) Single-family homes as of new production MSA AllTransit Score of workers with commute of more than 1 hour Permits per 100 HH added of renter- occupant households General market metrics Multifamily metrics Affordable and available rental units per 100 HH at 80 of AMI 86 Tenure cost proportion (rentown) Multi-unit buildings as of new production 34.7 United States 130,816.0 0.9 66.1 52.0 1.03 65.3 3.2 128.0 34.0 Exhibit 3-19 Housing Market Albuquerque Atlanta Austin Baltimore Birmingham Boise Boston Buffalo Cape CoralFort Myers Naples CharlestonNorth Charleston Charlotte Chattanooga, TNGA Chicago Cincinnati Cleveland Columbus DallasFort Worth DeltonaDaytona Beach Denver Des Moines Detroit Fort Lauderdale Gainesville Greenville, SC Hartford Honolulu Houston Indianapolis Inland Empire Jacksonville Jersey City Kansas City, MOKS Knoxville Las Vegas Long Island Los Angeles Louisville Madison Memphis Miami 381.9 2,375.4 960.0 1,122.4 481.3 310.6 1,927.1 493.0 519.2 346.8 1,090.2 233.6 3,714.8 898.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!71:  Class A property investments align with rent-by-choice higher- income households and a swelling population of aging Americans ready to downsize and simplify. B and C value-add investments suit a growing market of younger and mid-career households stuck in the limbo of scarce supply, high prices, and high interest mortgages that will delay their becoming homeowners. Closing a gaping, and widening, chasm in new investment and development would well serve households in the 80 to 120 percent range of area median household income levels the wage range of many essential workers such as teachers, sanitation workers, law enforcement officers, and fire and medical first responders. Furthermore, addressing this missing middle household income level does not preclude the need for additions to and preservation of properties for lower-income households. The Great Bottleneck: Local Ballot Boxes Apartment stakeholders number-one nemesis, blocking private- sector market solutions to deep and growing mismatches between demand and supply, is a many-headed hydraa bevy of deep-rooted restrictive land use, permitting, and regulatory cost burdens that thwart higher-density multifamily develop- ment. On top of these longstanding challenges, a growing push for rent regulation is adding uncertainty to the market. For example, while 26 states prohibit local municipalities from implementing rent control laws, five states permit localities to enforce rent controlNew York, New Jersey, California, Oregon, and Marylandas well as Washington, D. C. Regulations being proposed throughout the country would allow landlords to boost monthly rents by no more than 2 percent to 10 percent. Arizona, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, Washington, and Massachusetts have all introduced proposals to add or expand rent control protections. The problem of impact fees and NIMBYism really dominates many markets and makes it too expensive to develop, the CEO of one of the nations largest property management organizations says. I think were still stuck in the past. Some policymakers are not in tune. Voters who may not be well versed in these issues elect government officials who then become a huge wall to economic solutions. I dont see solutions for all this happening in my lifetime.;\n***\n[Submission]: According to the National Multifamily Housing Council (NMHC), the U.S. apartment property sector contributes $3.4 trillion annually to the U.S. economy .\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

Says one real estate investment banking executive, Its all going to be triggered by when major leases roll or debt matures or theres some debt extension test that comes up. Some of those buildings will come back to the lenders, but others may be can- didates for conversion to other uses. One affordable housing developer is optimistic about the poten- tial for more housing. Anybody whos sitting in city hall with a homelessness problem, which is pretty much everybody, needs to start thinking about how to take some of these office buildings and repurpose them into all flavors of residential, including some homeless shelters. But as with the aforementioned mall conversions, that would require a tremendous value decline to make such projects feasible, among other hurdles. That capitulation could be painful and really has yet to begin. Half of the industry people surveyed for Emerging Trends believe that central-city offices are over- priced. But at some point, owners may have no alternative to a serious writedown if office tenant demand keeps falling. Moving from Here to There Discussions with experienced practitioners for the upcoming ULI report, Behind the Facade: The Feasibility of Converting Commercial Real Estate to Multifamily, suggest several lessons that can increase the odds of successful conversions. First is the understanding that there is no cookie-cutter building to convert, particularly when converting commercial real estate to multifam- ily use. Not only is each experience different, but developers of successful conversions expect that each subsequent one will be different.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!36:  These conversions are often much easier to envision than to execute, however. The notion of converting obsolete malls into fulfillment centers, for example, has been a point of interest by both people inside and outside the real estate industry. But the case for these conversions can be easy to exaggerate. Nearby residents dont relish sharing local roads with big-rig trucks serv- ing these logistics facilities, while local governments resist losing retail sales tax revenue and jobs. And everyone laments losing what had been a community gathering place. But the greatest barrier to land use conversions is the value loss that owners must recognize in order to justify transformative investment and make projects feasible. Malls, for example, often command the highest values per square foot of any property type and warehouses among the lowest: converting a mall into a warehouse may require an enormous value writedown. It is possible to convert malls to uses with higher values than warehouses. For example, the Austin Community College con- verted Highland Mall into a mixed-use campus, while Amazon purchased the former Lord Taylor flagship store in Manhattan, aiming to convert the building into offices, though those plans have since been frozen as Amazon reevaluates its space needs. An even more likely step for failing malls is to convert just the most problematic portions. For example, at York Galleria in York, Pennsylvania, a former Sears was converted into a casino and then a vacant Bon-Ton department store into a self-storage facility. Whats Next for Office? Perhaps the biggest challenge confronting urban landlords and city leaders is what to do with all that older office space that increasingly looks redundant, obsolete, or both. One of the major problems we have in the office market right now is weve got a bunch of pre-1980 buildings that are function- ally obsolete, and we dont know what we do with them, says the global head of research for an investment management firm. The instinct of many owners will be to upgrade in order to attract new tenants. But that approach can be expensive, with the payoff highly uncertain. Owners of one older high-rise in Boston invested $300 million to convert the 1 million-square-foot con- crete building into a sleek glass-lined tower.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!43:  City centre sales space increased accordingly by more than 20 per cent in 2014. In response to the now lower demand for sales space, Gerber will be converted to a mixed use quarter by 2023. Further building plans in the city centre relate to the new construction of office and retail space to replace the former sports arena (Knig-Schulstrae) and the new Bundesbank building on the former Kaufhof site (Eberhardstrae). The con- verted Sport-Scheck will open at the beginning of the autumn as a pilot branch with a completely new concept over four floors. The Schlossgartenquartier group of buil- dings at the entrance to the Knigstrae will also be revitalised by 2025.

LOOKING AHEAD  The relentless math of higher interest rates will continue to weigh heavily on real estate values, at least until interest rates stabilize as inflation begins to subside. The bid- ask spread for private real estate should eventually close and transactions will resume in earnest at a rebased level.  In the meantime, investment styles that are less sensitive to volatility in values should be contemplated, such as floating-rate lending with a comfortable cushion from lower loan-to-value ratios. Debt investment can be attractive at times of uncertainty, as investors tilt toward contractually certain income and away from an uncertain upside. Portfolio aggregation strategies with smaller asset sizes that lend themselves to averaging-in with diversified timing of entry points represent another way to cope with volatile and uncertain values.  The inputs to the math are not changing to the same degree in every part of the world. Wherever rate spikes are less intense, or the prospects for rental growth are clearest, transaction activity and prices have been less impacted.  In addition to debt costs, investors should also consider the trajectory of cash flows, which depend on economic fundamentals and real estate occupier market conditions. The differential prospects for real estate cash flows are the subject of the next section.;\n\nreal_estate_index:global-real-estate-markets-2023.pdf-!1:  We also dive into student housing in the US, another sector booming among investors, and what impact demographic trends might have on it. In addition, we analyze how opportunistic and value-add managers will need to adopt their strategies now that interest rates are higher, and how their ability to generate out-size returns simply by adding leverage is gone. So, a number of important topics for us and investors to consider. We hope you find our answers insightful and useful in determining your strategy and thinking about some of the key questions in real estate as we move into the new year. Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy. Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs. We have already started to see cap rates and yields rise in many markets, with the most rapid adjustment taking place in the UK. However, we do not think that prices fully reflect higher interest rates yet. To assess when values might bottom out, we can look to past downturns and the listed market for guidance. In the Global Financial Crisis, for example, global capital values bottomed out in 4Q09, while GDP across global real estate markets troughed three quarters earlier, in 1Q09, as did global listed real estate prices1. Market downturns usually present opportunities, and one we expect for investors in 2023 is a correction in pricing as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. Although we do not expect large amounts of distress in the market, we do expect some, already apparent in parts of the UK market. This should allow investors access to assets at attractive pricing. The early 1990s downturn was longer, with US capital values continuing to decline into 1995. We expect modest declines in GDP in the first half of 2023 before growth resumes.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!8:  These conditions would be problematic for property markets: slowing or falling economic growth dampens tenant demand, while higher interest rates raise the cost of developing or acquiring properties. Both factors would cut returns and reduce values. Indeed, rising interest rates and uncertainty over future market conditions are already killing deals since sellers have not been ready to capitulate to buyers growing demands for price concessions, as we discuss in our capital markets trend. New Horizons Still, not all recessions are alike, and most economists, as well as Emerging Trends interviewees, expect any recession to be relatively short and shallow. Reflecting the view of several CRE leaders we interviewed, a senior executive with a global devel- opment and investment firm said, My gut says were going to have a recession, but its going to be relatively mild compared to some of the more severe recessions weve had. I dont see anything like the 2008 economic downturn going on. One leading CRE economist went so far as to say, I think were going into what I would say is a healthy down cycle. Its a cleansing, Schumpeterian idea that every so often, economies property markets includedneed to cleanse, and it washes out bad ideas, it washes out unrealistic unsustainable values. That reset presents new opportunities, even as it introduces uncertainty. Says the CEO of a development company, I think this is a moment in time. And when I look back historically, and I did not act in these moments in time, Ive always regretted it. The 10 emerging trends that we expect for 2023 and beyond follow: 1. Normalizing  Property market fundamentals are normalizing as some markets weaken due to diminishing pandemic tailwinds and the potential for a cyclical economic downturn. Exhibit 1-3 Importance of Issues for Real Estate in 2023 1 No importance 3 Moderate importance 5 Great importance  Some property sectors may cool, including residential and industrial, while others may heat up to historical average levels, such as hotels and retail.  Returns and prices of most assets are declining as cap rates rise and transaction volumes fall from record levels, while rent gains for others are merely moderating as demand returns to a more sustainable pace.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!59:  1 2 - c e D 2 2 - n a J 2 2 - b e F 2 2 - r a M 2 2 - r p A 2 2 - y a M 2 2 - n u J 2 2 - u J l 2 2 - g u A 2 2 - p e S 2 2 - t c O 2 2 - v o N Date of forecast GDP Forecast for: US 2023 Canada 2023 US 2024 Canada 2024 Source: Oxford Economics, as of November 16, 2022. around long-term interest rates and pricing than around near-term economic growth and real estate fundamentals. We are reluctant to make investment decisions based solely on a view of future interest rates, but acknowledge that real estate pricing is linked to future interest rates. Given this dynamic, we recommend investors consider a range of interest rate scenarios . Interest rate increases and the relentless math Each time interest rates ticked higher since the GFC, the question of when higher debt costs would impact real estate values was asked. It was a speculative question, with the underlying assumption that rate increases thus far had not yet impacted values. Regardless of the answer then, it became very clear in 2022 that the relentless math of higher borrowing rates was having an impact on leveraged returns and asset values . The boost investors were getting from borrowing has shifted to a drag on a cash basis, but with unleveraged internal rates of return generally above borrowing rates, leverage is still marginally accretive on a total return basis. However, with less lift from borrowing, leveraged buyers are largely out of the market . Higher borrowing rates are a function of both higher indices and increased borrowing spreads. Lending volume is down significantly and lenders are becoming more conservative. The supply of debt capital from large money center banks is down due to large positions taken in the first half of 2022 coupled with stress testing. The Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (CMBS) market continues to be impacted by volatility and life companies are looking into 2023 until fresh allocations become available.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, interest rates are projected to persistently climb, detrimentally affecting property values .\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

In Japan, yield curve control comes at the cost of a weak yen. If the Bank of Japan (BoJ) remains committed to keeping interest rates near zero, currency intervention, such as yen-buying to prevent further depreciation, could be on the table again. However, currency intervention has rarely been successful absent the cooperation from other central banks. Any changes to the yield control approach are likely to come after BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kurodas term concludes in April 2023. Nonetheless, most of the challenges Japan is facing are externally driven, while domestic-driven fundamentals remain relatively healthy. Australia, South Korea and Singapore are the most directly impacted by rising interest rates in the West. The outlook of these economies is likely to follow AP.1 Diverging monetary policies in Asia Pacific the trends in the West, albeit to varying degrees. The Monetary Authority of Singapore manages monetary policies through the foreign exchange markets, given that for a small and open economy, the exchange rate has a much stronger influence on inflation than the interest rate. That said, the magnitude of interest rate hikes in Singapore has been less than that of the US. Additionally, an increasing number of firms are pivoting to Singapore for their regional headquarters due to its geopolitical stability. All of these are adding to the relative strength of Singapores economy. The weakness of Asia Pacific currencies is mostly a story of US dollar strength. Nevertheless, uncertainties over the macro outlook and the dispersion among regional economies could lead to the continuing divergence of real estate market performance in the next 12-24 months. The diverse economic and real estate market trends within the region have the potential to contribute diversification benefits to institutional investors global portfolios. Three-month interest rates A S I A PAC I F I C Diverse, domestically- driven capital markets Commercial real estate transaction activities in Asia Pacific during the first nine months of 2022 came off 2021s record highs , primarily driven by rising interest rates in South Korea, Australia and Hong Kong, as well as COVID-19 lockdowns in China.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!35:  There was also some impact from Western investors withdrawing liquidity due to home-country denominator effects. Although we have observed shrinking pools of bidders and widening bid-ask spreads, particularly for large-sized assets, there has not been clear evidence of price corrections in most Asia Pacific markets except South Korea. Indeed, recent transaction activity has highlighted pockets of strength in some parts of the regions capital markets, particularly for assets in Singapore and multi-family rental across major markets. We also observe some early signs of investor appetite returning to hotels in countries that have re-opened or are re-opening. The Asia Pacific office sector has traditionally accounted for a significant allocation in most Asia Pacific investors real estate portfolios , and that is expected to continue. A share of liquidity reduction for office assets in the region can be attributed to unfavorable views towards office assets in investors home countries, particularly the US. The reduction in logistics transaction volumes has been primarily driven by high prices and lack of product for sale, as the occupier market outlook remains healthy in most markets. In 2023, rising interest rates are expected to put upward pressure on capitalization rates in markets with rising supply and for assets with weaker rental growth prospects. Capital market conditions vary significantly across the region. South Korea was the first developed market in Asia Pacific to experience material liquidity constraints. In addition, financial conditions have been tightening in Australia since May 2022 and are now as tight as those in South Korea. Australian REITs are likely to be more vulnerable to rising interest AP.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!44:   Tightening financial conditions, especially in South Korea and Australia, could create opportunities for higher return strategies. For investors with a higher risk tolerance, we recommend preserving dry powder and monitoring for pockets of price adjustment. It is time to be a patient opportunistwaiting and watching for attractive discounts if dislocation occurs in this region. LOOKING AHEAD  The math of rising interest rates in many Asia Pacific markets is expected to weigh on returns. In this environment, we recommend going back to basics. Supply-demand dynamics are critical in the context of a slowing economy with rising tenant operating costs. Market, submarket and asset selection are key, even in the favored sectors. Focus on asset management to achieve return targets instead of counting on market growth.  Japan remains an attractive diversifier for institutional investors regional and global real estate portfolios, due to the relative resiliency of its occupier and capital market fundamentals, its stable geopolitical environment and divergent monetary policies.

The regions mix of inflationary forces go beyond the usual supply chain pressures and tight labor markets, to include the more detrimental impact of exogenous shocks.  As of the time of writing, European energy costs were trending down due to warmer weather and full natural gas storage facilities going into the winter months. But Europe remains vulnerable and will have to invest rapidly to reduce its energy vulnerabilities over the coming years.  Property fundamentals remain reasonably benign in most European markets, cushioning some of the blow from a significant upward adjustment in yields that is being hidden from view by a wide bid-ask spread and decline in transaction volumes. Europe is beginning to adapt to a new economic and political reality. It is experiencing a severe negative energy shock on top of the normalization of fiscal and monetary policies that is occurring across other Western nations.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!38:  The probability that this cycle will end with a systemic dislocation like the Global Financial Crisis is still low, despite the short-term volatility.

Financial conditions in Singapore are expected to fare slightly better than those of South Korea and Australia, as Singapore benefits from strong investor appetite due to its relative economic strength and geopolitical stability. Although uncertainties remain, monetary easing, the rise of RMB funds, the rapid development of domestic REITs in China and the gradual relaxation of COVID restrictions in Hong Kong could offset some downside risks in these two capital markets.

Three, constrained construction of new supply, and a price run-up on the single-family for-sale front, spilled over into expanded apartment demand.  Lastly, compounding the effects of these four dramatic imbalances came the rocket fuel of a global capital rotation toward de-risked assets . Outsized demand, a sudden spike in remote work mobility, constricted supply, and floods of money with nowhere better to goa grand slam of anomalies. The U. S. apartment property sectorproviding shelter to 37 mil- lion residents in 21.3 million structures of five or more household units, and contributing $3.4 trillion annually to the U. S. economy, according to the NMHCmorphed quickly into an investment asset class pressure cooker. Inflated property valuations, com- pressed cap rates, and a sea change from individual owners to medium and large-sized corporate owners became a new norm seemingly overnight. This time period veers wildly from a steady slope of otherwise well-entrenched trends across the structural demand front. Operational modernization kicked into super-fast-forward mode toward self-service, and a robust new-development pipeline at least. According to a recent Bloomberg report, After dipping in 2020, the number of new units authorized in multifamily build- ings took off, running 37 percent higher over the past 12 months as of June 2022 than in the same period in 20182019. As of August, 862,000 apartments were under construction, up 25 percent from a year ago. At the same time, COVIDs aftermath sharply defined conflicting forceswhich together destine virtually all of Americas newly developed and built apartment communities for a financially privileged professional class. Rather than causing an expansion of rental housing stock, however, higher-income households come-lately demand for rental neighborhoods instead served to crowd out moderate- and lower-income households in supply- constrained areas. Its been virtually impossible to build affordable, says the chief executive of one of the apartment industry trade groups.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!27: 1 Changes to building codes over the past 10 years Sources: National Association of Home Builders. National Multifamily Housing Council. confidence suggests that that decline will likely continue until the interest rate environment turns more favorable. to a report from economists at the Fed, perhaps a reaction to lockdown claustrophobia. And the homes that do get built are expensive, particularly since the pandemic. Construction costs shot up due to supply chain disruptions and are still worrisome. As one housing industry adviser notes, Theres a stress index about global supply chains, and those stress indices are all indicating that theyre moderating, but theyre still at very high levels. Finally, high permitting fees and utility charges and large minimum lot sizes push developers to build more expensive homes. Renters Priced Out of the Homebuying Market With a growing share of households priced out of the for-sale market, demand for rental units is far outstripping new supply. Though population growth slowed sharply during the pandemic, demand is also rising from the many young adults eager to start their own households after moving back in with their parents during COVID. Further boosting demand is the increasing number of younger adults choosing to live alone, according The multifamily sector has responded with an unprecedented increase in new supply. Weve built more multifamily housing units over the last 10 years than we had in any other time since 1980, notes an adviser to institutional investors. But it is still far less than needed. Vacancies have fallen to their lowest levels ever while rents are rising faster than evereven faster than home prices. And though not a formal part of the affordability calculations, other housing-related costs like utilities and main- tenance are also rising faster than incomes, further constraining the ability of households to afford basic shelter. Moving to More Affordable Recent slowdowns in rent growth and home price appreciation, noted in our Normalizing trend, have done little to increase affordability. So how to address this? Millions of people have taken matters into their own hands.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!170: 45 4.44 4.43 3.95 3.75 3.59 3.56 3.55 3.55 3.51 3.33 3.23 3.11 2.93 2.91 Source: Emerging Trends in Real Estate 2023 survey. Note: Based on Canadian respondents only. 92 To be sure, the current environment offers relief from the intense bidding competition of recent years, which was also creating challenges for real estate companies. But for now, the height- ened uncertainty is leading many players to stay on the sidelines as they wait to see where the market, particularly when it comes to pricing and valuations, settles. One interviewee noted their cautious approach when they said that they were sticking to the fairway, not trying to clear the trees and skip the dogleg, when it comes to deployment decisions. Cost Escalations amid Supply Chain Challenges and Labor Shortages On top of concerns about the capital markets are supply chain shortages and delays as well as significant increases in costs for labor and materials. Labor issues have been a challenge for some time, but rising costs and shortages of inputs including for key materials like steelhave added to the pressures. According to Statistics Canada, residential building costs were up 22.6 percent on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter of 2022. For nonresidential construction, cost increases were lower but still significant at 12.8 percent. Construction cost increases continued into the second quarter of 2022 amid inflationary pressures throughout the economy. Rising labor shortages are exacerbating the challenges. According to Statistics Canada, construction job vacancies reached a record high in the first quarter of 2022 and were double the number of open positions during the same period in 2020. And then there is the impact of construction wages, which were up 6.6 percent in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2021. All of this has made completing projects on time and on budget even harder than in the past, and the situation is unlikely to improve in the foreseeable future.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!29:  So far, migra- tion from the highest-priced markets has not been enough to actually reduce housing costs in those markets, though costs generally are rising more slowly there. Demographics and the slowing economy could also help ease the housing imbalance. The nations population is growing at its slowest pace ever, thanks to both low birth and immigration rates. And fewer buyers are on the hunt for homes now due to affordability and concerns about possible job losses in a recession. The good news is that it is an opportunity for home- builders and land developers to do a little catch-up. Theyve been running behind for two years, and they may actually welcome a little respite to finish the homes that they have sold, thinks a senior adviser to many homebuilders. But these favorable trends alone will not be nearly enough to solve the affordability quandary. What else would help? As we outlined in previous editions of Emerging Trendswhen hous- ing was less expensive than it is nowthere are no easy fixes, but several obvious policy options would help: notably, lowering the many obstacles to housing construction, decreasing rising regulatory costs , and expediting approvals. Technology can play a bigger role in actually delivering homes by helping bring innovation and cost efficiencies to a sector that has been notoriously slow to change. Most notable are different approaches to prefabricated and modular housing in which much or all of the house is built in a factory and then assembled on the homesite. These methods can dramatically reduce the need for labor and shrink production times at more affordable costs. Promising innovations are also arising from the nascent single-fam- ily build-to-rent sector, which is learning how to scale construction and design to reduce costs and development time, as explained in our single-family sector overview found in chapter 2. Government could also expand affordable housing produc- tion. Unfortunately, Congress dropped the affordable housing components of the proposed Build Back Better Act from what became the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, meaning that no additional federal help is on the way. But many state and local governments are stepping into the breach, as we discuss in our final trend on regulation.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, constrained construction of new supply was a consequence of labor shortages and cautious construction pacing from homebuilders .\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

Meanwhile, apartment rents have continued to push ever higher, but the pace has been moderating in recent months. Construction starts also have slowed. The National Association of Home Builders housing market index has fallen for eight straight months through August 2022 to its lowest level since May 2020. This is not to say that were in a housing recessionfar from it. Homes are still selling at a healthy rate by historical levels, and home prices remain near record levels. And while multifamily vacancies are at their lowest level in four decades and rents continue to log new records every month, the rates of increase have been slowing and are expected to decelerate further, according to many experts we interviewed. Maybe you dont see the 10 percentplus rent growth in multifamily markets, says the head of one institutional investment advisory firm. They should come back to more of a long-term historical average of 3 percent to 4 percent, and maybe offset some of the unafford- ability in the country. Indeed, housing markets may be partly victims of their own success as record prices and rents mean fewer households can afford to buy homes or rent apartments, particularly with mort- gage interest rates and housing-related expenses like utilities 6 rising sharplya topic we explore in Too Much for Too Many, our trend on housing affordability. The Amazon Pause The white-hot industrial market also seems set to cool after sev- eral years of unprecedented demand growth and rent gains that have pushed rents far above prior records. Growth in e-com- merce is slowing and giving back some of the market share it captured from physical retailers during the pandemic. Amazon, the largest warehouse user in the United States, has delayed occupying numerous completed projects, trying to sublet many, as it slows its physical growthwhat some are calling the Amazon pause. Other major retailers also have been cutting back their distribution expansion plans. To be sure, the industrial sector still enjoys record-low vacancy rates, as demand for high-quality, well-located logistics facilities has been running ahead of the markets ability to supply them.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2023_Housing_market_outlook__Price_dip_and_interes.pdf-!2:  For example, the press releases of the Federal Statistical Office reported further price increases until the third quarter, although the price index had already passed its peak. It was not until the fourth quarter that the price index of the Federal Statistical Office fell by 3.6 year-on-year and by as much as 5 compared with the previous quarter. The bulwiengesa data also indicated a further rise in prices, as the annual data published on December 10 are annual averages and the quarterly data are rolling four- quarter averages. In addition, transactions are only indirectly included in the time series via analysts. Higher-frequency and transaction-based time series are therefore more in focus. The monthly Europace index, for example, has been falling since the spring of 2022. From peak to trough, prices for existing homes fell by around 12, and the index for apartments by as much as 15. However, prices for new homes initially ran sideways and then recently picked up again. In February 2023, the most recent data point, new home prices even increased strongly by more than 2 from the previous month. All three price indices are also published as hedonic indices, which factor out differences in quality. Since the spring of 2022, these have recorded an increase of almost 5 for new houses, and a drop of more than 8 for existing houses and apartments. The hedonic price indices are thus rising more strongly or falling less. The sharp price declines in the non-hedonic price indices are evidently also due to the fact that it is primarily properties of lower quality that are changing hands. The vdp indices which are calculated exclusively on a hedonic basis confirm this statement. These indices which are published quarterly only began to fall in the second half of the year. In the metropolitan areas , apartments, single- family houses and multi-family houses fell by around 3 from their high point in the second quarter. Nationwide, prices for both single-family houses and condominiums were down by only around 1 . These indices thus also support our expectation that prices will ease only slightly. In the course of 2023, the focus is likely to be on the transaction-based indices of Europace and vdp.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Deloitte 2023 Commercial Real Estate Outlook.pdf-!28:  Everett-Allen, House prices in global cities rising at their fastest rate since Q3 2004, Knight Frank Research, 12.

Compiled by Nelson Economics. Though prices began to fall modestly in the summer, as we discuss in the Normalizing trend, prices are still near record levels nationally. The rise in mortgage rates alone has had a significant impact. John Burns Real Estate Consulting calculated that the number of U. S. households that could afford a $400,000 mortgageabout the mortgage amount required to purchase the median-priced home with a 5 percent downpaymentdropped by 16.5 million due to rising interest rates, just in the first half of 2022. That hurts. But the fundamental issue is the overall chronic undersupply of housing, especially at affordable price points. The challenges are hardly new. Restrictive zoning and build- ing codes block or limit new supply, while NIMBYism delays and curbs approvals of even as-of-right projects. Affordable housing developers complain that increasingly complex deals now require more underwriting from more capital sources. One developer says, The average deal for us used to take 90 days to close, and now its over six months. Some experts we interviewed believe that the rise of single- family rentals (SFRs) also contributes to declining affordability of for-sale housing. Proponents argue that SFRs extend the opportunity to live in a single-family house to those who cannot afford to buy or just dont want to, while generally expanding the supply of rental housing. But critics point out that institutional capital is driving up prices in the resale market, in the words of one housing adviser, by outbidding owneroccupant homebuy- ers for existing homes.;\n***\n[Submission]: Answer: New home prices reached their highest point in April 2022 according to .\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

Solid demand for retail space in the first half of 2022 halted the downward rent trend of several years. Prime rents, which had fallen by just over 10 per cent overall, stabilised on average at EUR 265 per m2. However, a deterioration in household spending power and the downturn in consumer sentiment could inflict more damage on space rental in city centres. Many households are well supp- lied with clothing, footwear and electronic goods and can defer new purchases. The sales outlook for city centre retail is correspondingly poor.  The repurposing of obsolete retail space is already in full swing. Retailers loo- king for space are in a strong negotiating position given the large supply of pro- perty. The strong recovery in footfall and the number of tourists is indicative of the potentially good prospects for city centre retail.

Virtually no large interconnected office space was available from the existing stock and most rental contracts were therefore for project develop- ments. However, the pandemic - which made working from home acceptable in Germany - led to a weakening of rental business.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!27:  DOWNWARD RENT TREND COMES TO A HALT IN 2022 PRIME RETAIL RENTS IN EUR PER M Top locations prove robust in the retail crisis Prime rents have stopped falling VOLUME OF LET RETAIL SPACE INCREASES IN 2022 RENTED RETAIL SPACE IN TOP LOCATIONS IN M 160,000 140,000 120,000 100,000 80,000 60,000 40,000 20,000 0 H1 2022 H1 2021 H1 2020 H1 2019 average 2015-2019 Source: JLL Rental activity increases, but remains much lower than previously Space supply still good 2008 2010 2012 2014 2018 2020 2022 2016 Dsseldorf Cologne Frankfurt Munich Berlin Hamburg Stuttgart Source: bulwiengesa The stabilisation in the rent trend is due to a further uptick in rental activity. According to data from JLL, around 76,000 m2 was let in the first half of 2022, about a quarter more than in the first half of 2021. About a third of the sales space newly let in the top locations is in Berlin. However, the current volume of retail space let is nowhere near the levels of previous years. On average, from 2015 to 2019 letting perfor- mance was more than twice as high in the same period. Retailers looking for sales space in the top locations still have fairly good prospects of success. The space availability ratio calculated by JLL remains at a similarly high level as in 2021. Despite the uptick in rental business it has not declined. Previous and forthcoming closures of department stores and sports stores are contributory factors here since subsequent usage is not a done deal everywhere.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!4:  Rents stopped rising, and the number of vacant properties increased.  Rental activity has gained pace again since the end of 2021. Office space is also in demand again. Appropriate office space is needed for the new hot desking office concepts now being adopted by many companies. Because contemporary office space is still in short supply, rents are correspondingly high, and prime rents for high-end and sustainable office space are therefore increasing again. Interest in office properties with low energy efficiency, on the other hand, is likely to wane among tenants and investors alike.  However, with the German economy at risk of recession, the headwind for office rentals is clearly intensifying. The upward rent trend could therefore flatten once again. In addition to net rents, additional costs for heating and air conditioning Retail: City centre retail squeezed by E-commerce, Covid and inflation Office: Market gains pace in 2022, but could be hampered by risk of recession 5 Residential: Rents could continue to rise mode- rately despite gas crisis have also risen sharply, and the cost of office space is therefore increasing in any case. Since most space under construction has already been pre-let, the deferral of office projects could however intensify the shortage of contemporary office space.

Sustainability is not completely top of mind on the U. S. political agenda which is focused more on social inclusion. The corporate and international investor community is, however, acknowledging the need for more sustainable buildings. Individual cities rather than the national government are leading the U. S. on this topic. Prime offices in the sunbelt cities appear to be better positioned due to migration patterns and rising employment and the drop in values is expected to be confined to around 5 over 2022. During the outlook period we expect East and West Coast office values to shed roughly an additional 10 while pricing in the Sunbelt cities and Miami will, for the most part, remain relatively steady. Yields are expected to move out by around 30bps over the outlook period. Bouwinvest Outlook 2023-2025 17 North America Logistics Retail The sector continues to be buoyed by fundamental demand drivers such as e-commerce, supply chain reconfiguration and government (infrastructure) investment programmes. Rental growth is therefore expected to remain positive during the outlook period, rising approximately 3 on average per annum during 2023-2025. The shopping centre market in North America was hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic which accelerated the already visible negative trend. A partial recovery took place in 2022, but the outlook period is expected to be challenging due to high inflation, low consumer confidence and a weaker economic outlook. The growth of e-commerce is expected to slow, however, due to the fading pandemic and an expected economic recession. We expect the volume of new leasing transactions to be more sluggish than in the exceptionally strong years of 2020 and 2021. E-commerce giant Amazon, the largest corporate user of logistics space in the U.

In reaction, the Ministry of Finance intervened in the FX market for the first time since 1998 to stabilize the currency. Page 4 of 8 The other would focus on fundamentals, and argue that even at a lower entry yield the potential for income growth over the investment period can mitigate some of the value depreciation from rising rates. We would side with the second argument. First, risk should define the yield. This means that assets with a higher risk profile will need to adjust to an even higher yield to maintain a risk premium over more core assets. And second, in a period of high inflation, the value of the income of an asset will erode unless it can generate rental growth. Higher yielding assets generally come from sectors with weak occupational demand, hence the risk of void periods and negative rental growth are much higher, particularly during a period of economic stress. Sectors including life sciences, student accommodation, cold storage logistics and self- storage where there are strong structural drivers to support rental growth, are expected to see the greatest value protection. This was welcome news for markets. While unlikely to change the JPY direction, we take comfort that both the government and the BoJ are on the same page. First, this helps to buy time until the US Fed softens its hawkish stance. Second, there is also a positive implication that the next BoJ governor due to be appointed in April 2023 will not deviate materially. To be clear, an exit from the ultra-loose policy is possible in the medium-term. However, it will most likely be done in a gradual manner. For 2023, at least, the current policy should stay and the chances are even higher now that the peak of global inflation and interest rates are drawing close. Will Japan remain an outlier market with low interest rates? With VC funding slowing, what is the outlook for life sciences real estate? Based on data from Pitchbook,global venture capital invested into life sciences companies in 2022 is set to fall by around 25 on the volume recorded in 2021.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!34:  Economic growth in China in 2023 should be below historical averages, but strong enough to make it one of the fastest growing large economies. In Japan, yield curve control comes at the cost of a weak yen. If the Bank of Japan (BoJ) remains committed to keeping interest rates near zero, currency intervention, such as yen-buying to prevent further depreciation, could be on the table again. However, currency intervention has rarely been successful absent the cooperation from other central banks. Any changes to the yield control approach are likely to come after BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kurodas term concludes in April 2023. Nonetheless, most of the challenges Japan is facing are externally driven, while domestic-driven fundamentals remain relatively healthy. Australia, South Korea and Singapore are the most directly impacted by rising interest rates in the West. The outlook of these economies is likely to follow AP.1 Diverging monetary policies in Asia Pacific the trends in the West, albeit to varying degrees. The Monetary Authority of Singapore manages monetary policies through the foreign exchange markets, given that for a small and open economy, the exchange rate has a much stronger influence on inflation than the interest rate. That said, the magnitude of interest rate hikes in Singapore has been less than that of the US. Additionally, an increasing number of firms are pivoting to Singapore for their regional headquarters due to its geopolitical stability. All of these are adding to the relative strength of Singapores economy. The weakness of Asia Pacific currencies is mostly a story of US dollar strength. Nevertheless, uncertainties over the macro outlook and the dispersion among regional economies could lead to the continuing divergence of real estate market performance in the next 12-24 months. The diverse economic and real estate market trends within the region have the potential to contribute diversification benefits to institutional investors global portfolios.

LOOKING AHEAD  The relentless math of higher interest rates will continue to weigh heavily on real estate values, at least until interest rates stabilize as inflation begins to subside. The bid- ask spread for private real estate should eventually close and transactions will resume in earnest at a rebased level.  In the meantime, investment styles that are less sensitive to volatility in values should be contemplated, such as floating-rate lending with a comfortable cushion from lower loan-to-value ratios. Debt investment can be attractive at times of uncertainty, as investors tilt toward contractually certain income and away from an uncertain upside. Portfolio aggregation strategies with smaller asset sizes that lend themselves to averaging-in with diversified timing of entry points represent another way to cope with volatile and uncertain values.  The inputs to the math are not changing to the same degree in every part of the world. Wherever rate spikes are less intense, or the prospects for rental growth are clearest, transaction activity and prices have been less impacted.  In addition to debt costs, investors should also consider the trajectory of cash flows, which depend on economic fundamentals and real estate occupier market conditions. The differential prospects for real estate cash flows are the subject of the next section.;\n\nreal_estate_index:global-real-estate-markets-2023.pdf-!2:  Overall, we think that global capital values will bottom out in the second half of 2023, with the timing dependent upon how the economy fairs and a longer adjustment possible. 1 According to MSCI Global Quarterly Property Index and FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Index in USD. For example, owners who are forced to sell assets because they are unable to refinance debt or need to sell for other reasons, such as generating liquidity quickly. In such situations, sellers may be willing to accept below-market prices, or indeed have to, in order to facilitate a sale. For investors wanting to deploy capital now, holding off for a few months as pricing adjusts is probably the best strategy. Given the higher interest rate environment, we also think that floating rate real estate debt is an attractive way to achieve strong inflation protected returns and generate a good income return from real estate. Finally, looking across the globe, another potential opportunity for investors in 2023 is Japan, due to accretive hedging gains for investment into this market. Indeed, investors need to be mindful of large differences in monetary policy as interest rate differentials between countries determine the cost of hedging. Currently, Japan is particularly attractive on an after-hedging basis, since interest rates there are lower than in other markets. Page 3 of 8 What opportunities exist for investors in 2023? Which markets and sectors are the most defensive? There are two schools of thought in answering this question. One would argue that higher yielding assets offer greater value protection as they have a wider spread to the rising bond yields, and in some cases leverage can still be accretive. Yes, we think so. Japans economic recovery has lagged. The labor market improved in 2022, but is still soft relative to 2019. October inflation at 3.6 was the highest in four decades, but modest versus other countries. The pressure was also largely imported while domestic inflation stayed benign. In that context, maintaining the loose monetary policy appears the right thing to do. However, something has to give due to this diverging policy stance versus elsewhere.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, it would be right to state that, despite external pressures, Japan is anticipated to uphold steady monetary policies with the Bank of Japan maintaining interest rates close to zero, ensuring the differential between property yields and the risk-free rate remains constant .\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

Solid demand for retail space in the first half of 2022 halted the downward rent trend of several years. Prime rents, which had fallen by just over 10 per cent overall, stabilised on average at EUR 265 per m2. However, a deterioration in household spending power and the downturn in consumer sentiment could inflict more damage on space rental in city centres. Many households are well supp- lied with clothing, footwear and electronic goods and can defer new purchases. The sales outlook for city centre retail is correspondingly poor.  The repurposing of obsolete retail space is already in full swing. Retailers loo- king for space are in a strong negotiating position given the large supply of pro- perty. The strong recovery in footfall and the number of tourists is indicative of the potentially good prospects for city centre retail.

Virtually no large interconnected office space was available from the existing stock and most rental contracts were therefore for project develop- ments. However, the pandemic - which made working from home acceptable in Germany - led to a weakening of rental business.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!4:  Rents stopped rising, and the number of vacant properties increased.  Rental activity has gained pace again since the end of 2021. Office space is also in demand again. Appropriate office space is needed for the new hot desking office concepts now being adopted by many companies. Because contemporary office space is still in short supply, rents are correspondingly high, and prime rents for high-end and sustainable office space are therefore increasing again. Interest in office properties with low energy efficiency, on the other hand, is likely to wane among tenants and investors alike.  However, with the German economy at risk of recession, the headwind for office rentals is clearly intensifying. The upward rent trend could therefore flatten once again. In addition to net rents, additional costs for heating and air conditioning Retail: City centre retail squeezed by E-commerce, Covid and inflation Office: Market gains pace in 2022, but could be hampered by risk of recession 5 Residential: Rents could continue to rise mode- rately despite gas crisis have also risen sharply, and the cost of office space is therefore increasing in any case.

According to data from JLL, around 76,000 m2 was let in the first half of 2022, about a quarter more than in the first half of 2021. About a third of the sales space newly let in the top locations is in Berlin. However, the current volume of retail space let is nowhere near the levels of previous years. On average, from 2015 to 2019 letting perfor- mance was more than twice as high in the same period. Retailers looking for sales space in the top locations still have fairly good prospects of success. The space availability ratio calculated by JLL remains at a similarly high level as in 2021. Despite the uptick in rental business it has not declined. Previous and forthcoming closures of department stores and sports stores are contributory factors here since subsequent usage is not a done deal everywhere.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!26:  However, the preconditions for this have not improved. Companies and the public sector are dealing with crisis management and challenges such as climate change. Property values may also come under pressure because yields are higher.

Too low a quality of stay could lead to a downward spi- ral. If customers stay away, retailers and bars and restaurants will withdraw, causing the offer to deteriorate further. Retail: comparison of top locations The retail headwind has also had an impact on flagship stores accustomed to suc- cess, particularly since the time was undoubtedly right for a painful adjustment here. On the one hand, previous years saw the emergence of a large volume of new retail space, for example in the form of city centre shopping centres. On the other hand, prime rents are not only highest here, they are also much stronger than in other large German cities. However, no major crisis has materialised, and below the line seven top locations have even performed comparatively well. Prime rents have fallen on average by a fairly moderate 10 per cent or so from their 2017 peak, although since 2010 they had previously increased by more than a quar- ter. Conversely, prime rents in other large cities declined more sharply, but without the previous strong increase. In the group of top locations, prime rents in Stuttgart showed the steepest decline of nearly 20 per cent. In contrast, rent levels in Dssel- dorf city centre remained largely constant. The fact that the downward rent trend has not continued in 2022 and that all seven top locations have managed to maintain their peak rents since the end of 2021 is positive.;\n***\n[Submission]: The prime rents for the top locations declined by just over 10% overall by the conclusion of 2021 .\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

French and Spanish cities posted quarter-on-quarter yield increases of between 15 and 25bps. As risk-free rates are up and expected to remain elevated between 2023 and 2025, we believe office capital values could soften further during the outlook period, and we estimate prime yields in Europe will move out by another 50bps. This would amount to a value loss of around 10 to 15 before stabilization and recovery takes place. Office transaction volumes in Europe already fell by over 20 during Q2 2022 compared with the same year-earlier period. Bouwinvest Outlook 2023-2025 9 Europe Logistics Covid-19 had a surprisingly positive effect on European logistics markets with the accelerated adoption of online shopping more than offsetting the economic turmoil. Now that the pandemic appears to be largely under control, the pace of e-commerce growth has eased, but is still positive and the potential for further expansion remains strong as consumers service expectations continue to evolve and drive demand for logistics properties. reluctance among municipalities to issue land for new logistic space. We expect this latter trend to continue in the coming years, with Germany and France currently showing the most resistance to new greenfield developments. As a result, nominal rental growth, although slowing down, is expected to remain positive during the outlook period at a figure just shy of 3.0 per annum. Global supply chain disruption following the pandemic and ongoing geopolitical tensions are also fuelling a supply chain reconfiguration with a greater emphasis on onshoring over just-in-time. This is boosting domestic demand for logistics real estate and helping to ease wider supply chain pressures. European economic support programmes running until 2027 and totalling 1.1 trillion are expected to provide another boost to the sector. The volume of new supply coming to market is meanwhile decreasing due to both rising construction costs and a Capital values of prime logistics properties are forecast to decline by an average 7-8 in Q4 2022 compared with Q4 2021 levels.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!10: 2 Transaction volume down meaningfully Most pronounced reduction in activity is in Europe Year-over-year change in quarterly transaction volume But just as it was with COVID-19, the transition to a more stabilized state is uncertain and likely to have unexpected twists and turns. We have identified five global themes that we think investors should keep in mind as we move through the acute phase of monetary tightening toward a more stable global economy. G LO BA L In this ISA Outlook 2023, we look through the current acute period of volatility and uncertainty to discuss our view of likely outcomes and scenarios to consider, key themes for investing and real estate strategy recommendations that we expect to be resilient across the range of conceivable macro environments. Inflation should eventually settle closer to central banks target levels, allowing the longed-for pivot in interest rates. Bid-ask spreads in real estate capital markets will narrow, allowing activity to resume at an adjusted pricing level. The attraction of real estate as an asset class will endure, with variation around sectors, assets and geographies.

All of these positive and negative factors together paint a kind of a Rorschach test, where observers can draw their own conclusions as to the strength of the economy. The End of the Beginning But there is one issue on which our interviewees agree: The exis- tential risk for the real estate economy right now is that Fed action in response to persistent inflation will tip us into a recession, says a senior partner with a leading advisory firm. But can the Federal Reserve Bank tame inflation without breaking the economy? Moderating inflation rates this summer led many to believe that the worst was over and that the Fed could soon ease up its con- tractionary monetary policy. Indeed, the consensus of experts we interviewed this summer was that the Fed would cease tightening by the end of 2022 and start cutting rates again in mid-2023. That sentiment now appears optimistic. Inflation is going to be a little stickier than people think, said an investment banking executive we interviewed during the summer, whose views turned out to be more prescient. Sentiment started changing in late August when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell gave his annual speech to fellow central bankers affirming the Fed view that infla- tion is not nearly under control, jolting markets. Any remaining doubt about that was quashed by the official Fed commentary accompanying their September rate announcement projecting that rates would keep rising through 2023. As Winston Churchill famously cautioned after the British army won a critical WWII battle, the victory marked not the end, not even the beginning of the end, but, possibly, the end of the beginning. 4 Higher for Longer With interest rates headed higher for longer, the risk of a deeper, full-fledged recession is rising, according to a grow- ing consensus of economists. In an August 2022 survey by the National Association of Business Economics, only a quarter of economists were even somewhat confident that the Fed could bring down inflation to its target range without causing a recession. Worrying signs out of Europe in early autumn and expectations of soaring heating bills this coming winter add to the gloomy global economic outlook.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!15: 5 Spiking rates drive rapid tightening of financial conditions Cost of capital rising sharply in most geographies Nominal corporate bond yields 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 7 0 n a J 8 0 n a J 9 0 n a J 0 1 n a J 1 1 n a J 2 1 n a J 3 1 n a J 4 1 n a J 5 1 n a J 6 1 n a J 7 1 n a J 8 1 n a J 9 1 n a J 0 2 n a J 1 2 n a J 2 2 n a J US C.

LOOKING AHEAD  The relentless math of higher interest rates will continue to weigh heavily on real estate values, at least until interest rates stabilize as inflation begins to subside. The bid- ask spread for private real estate should eventually close and transactions will resume in earnest at a rebased level.  In the meantime, investment styles that are less sensitive to volatility in values should be contemplated, such as floating-rate lending with a comfortable cushion from lower loan-to-value ratios. Debt investment can be attractive at times of uncertainty, as investors tilt toward contractually certain income and away from an uncertain upside. Portfolio aggregation strategies with smaller asset sizes that lend themselves to averaging-in with diversified timing of entry points represent another way to cope with volatile and uncertain values.  The inputs to the math are not changing to the same degree in every part of the world. Wherever rate spikes are less intense, or the prospects for rental growth are clearest, transaction activity and prices have been less impacted.  In addition to debt costs, investors should also consider the trajectory of cash flows, which depend on economic fundamentals and real estate occupier market conditions. The differential prospects for real estate cash flows are the subject of the next section.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!5:  1 2 Taking the Long View The short-term risks are real, and Im not making light of any of them. But if you have the long view, I dont think its time to panic. 100 s t n e d n o p s e r f o e g a t n e c r e P 80 60 40 20 0 Interest rates are rising, economic clouds are darkening, and real estate deal flows are sinking because buyers and sellers cannot agree on pricing. But for all that, most commercial real estate professionals we interviewed for this years Emerging Trends remain reasonably upbeat about longer-term prospects. Not everyone is as sanguine as the CEO of an investment management firm who provided our opening quote, and there certainly are some troubling risks ahead for the industry. But the consensus mood seems to be one of cautious optimism that we will ride out any near-term slump and be well positioned for another period of sustained growth and strong returns. It makes sense that real estate experts would take the long view given the nature of real estate assets: buildings take a long time to conceive and develop. Even simply acquiring one typically takes more time than buying just about any other type of financial asset, and they are usually held for longer dura- tions. Still, the willingness of so many people in the industry to look beyond some of the cyclical headwinds is striking. Says the head of advisory services for a commercial real estate (CRE) analytics firm, The recessionif we go into onewill obviously impact some markets worse than others, but its just like any- thing else. Well look back in 10 years, and the prices that seem astronomical today will seem like a bargain 10 years from now. An Economic Rorschach Test By one popular rule of thumb, the U. S. economy entered a recession in the first half of 2022, having sustained two straight quarters of (modestly) declining gross domestic product (GDP). But if we were in a recession at the time of writing, it would be a most peculiar one.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!16:  G LO BA L 2 The path of fundamentals will ultimately help determine where values settle Early in 2022, we framed the impact of rising inflation and interest rates on values as a race between debt costs and net operating income growth, as we anticipated that higher inflation would translate into higher rents in some sectors. Currently, it seems that debt costs are mostly winning the race. Ultimately, however, valuations are the result of the interaction between higher debt costs and the path of real estate fundamentals, the prospects for which vary widely across sectors and geographies. Tracing back real estate cash flows to their drivers is to follow a chain of causation back to basic variables like population, GDP, industrial production, consumer spending and employment. All of these interact with real estate factors, such as the balance of property supply and occupier demand, to influence property cash flows. Secular megatrends and structural features like legal and contractual constraints also matter. Going into 2023, there is increased uncertainty in many of these variables, especially the economic ones, given the pace of economic expansion is expected to be weaker or negative. This will have a cooling impact on property NOI growth, but nuances remain given that the transmission of macroeconomic conditions to real estate is a winding path. Starting with the underlying economic fundamentals, we are seeing a great deal of variation globally. In addition to the dimensions of depth and duration, a key uncertainty surrounding the coming downturn is how widespread it will be. Europe faces especially severe challenges stemming from an energy price shock, with ripple effects of unknown global scope. The dominant driver of inflation in the US, Canada and Singapore is that their economies are robust and operating close to full capacity. Demand- led inflation is relatively benign compared to inflation from a supply shock, but the central banks in these countries must still raise interest rates, either to manage their domestic economic situations or because their monetary policies are linked to the US Federal Reserve . Rising interest rates create clear risks to economic growth, with housing markets already being impacted by higher mortgage rates. Europes employment picture is also solid, but in addition to home-grown inflation, it is coping with a severe, energy-driven supply shock caused by the Russia-Ukraine war.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, the apprehension about the duration the Fed will continue escalating rates is valid, given that these rising rates could adversely affect property values.\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

In reaction, the Ministry of Finance intervened in the FX market for the first time since 1998 to stabilize the currency. Page 4 of 8 The other would focus on fundamentals, and argue that even at a lower entry yield the potential for income growth over the investment period can mitigate some of the value depreciation from rising rates. We would side with the second argument. First, risk should define the yield. This means that assets with a higher risk profile will need to adjust to an even higher yield to maintain a risk premium over more core assets. And second, in a period of high inflation, the value of the income of an asset will erode unless it can generate rental growth. Higher yielding assets generally come from sectors with weak occupational demand, hence the risk of void periods and negative rental growth are much higher, particularly during a period of economic stress. Sectors including life sciences, student accommodation, cold storage logistics and self- storage where there are strong structural drivers to support rental growth, are expected to see the greatest value protection. This was welcome news for markets. While unlikely to change the JPY direction, we take comfort that both the government and the BoJ are on the same page. First, this helps to buy time until the US Fed softens its hawkish stance. Second, there is also a positive implication that the next BoJ governor due to be appointed in April 2023 will not deviate materially. To be clear, an exit from the ultra-loose policy is possible in the medium-term. However, it will most likely be done in a gradual manner. For 2023, at least, the current policy should stay and the chances are even higher now that the peak of global inflation and interest rates are drawing close. Will Japan remain an outlier market with low interest rates? With VC funding slowing, what is the outlook for life sciences real estate?

In Japan, yield curve control comes at the cost of a weak yen. If the Bank of Japan (BoJ) remains committed to keeping interest rates near zero, currency intervention, such as yen-buying to prevent further depreciation, could be on the table again. However, currency intervention has rarely been successful absent the cooperation from other central banks. Any changes to the yield control approach are likely to come after BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kurodas term concludes in April 2023. Nonetheless, most of the challenges Japan is facing are externally driven, while domestic-driven fundamentals remain relatively healthy. Australia, South Korea and Singapore are the most directly impacted by rising interest rates in the West. The outlook of these economies is likely to follow AP.1 Diverging monetary policies in Asia Pacific the trends in the West, albeit to varying degrees. The Monetary Authority of Singapore manages monetary policies through the foreign exchange markets, given that for a small and open economy, the exchange rate has a much stronger influence on inflation than the interest rate. That said, the magnitude of interest rate hikes in Singapore has been less than that of the US. Additionally, an increasing number of firms are pivoting to Singapore for their regional headquarters due to its geopolitical stability. All of these are adding to the relative strength of Singapores economy. The weakness of Asia Pacific currencies is mostly a story of US dollar strength. Nevertheless, uncertainties over the macro outlook and the dispersion among regional economies could lead to the continuing divergence of real estate market performance in the next 12-24 months.

LOOKING AHEAD  The relentless math of higher interest rates will continue to weigh heavily on real estate values, at least until interest rates stabilize as inflation begins to subside. The bid- ask spread for private real estate should eventually close and transactions will resume in earnest at a rebased level.  In the meantime, investment styles that are less sensitive to volatility in values should be contemplated, such as floating-rate lending with a comfortable cushion from lower loan-to-value ratios. Debt investment can be attractive at times of uncertainty, as investors tilt toward contractually certain income and away from an uncertain upside. Portfolio aggregation strategies with smaller asset sizes that lend themselves to averaging-in with diversified timing of entry points represent another way to cope with volatile and uncertain values.  The inputs to the math are not changing to the same degree in every part of the world. Wherever rate spikes are less intense, or the prospects for rental growth are clearest, transaction activity and prices have been less impacted.  In addition to debt costs, investors should also consider the trajectory of cash flows, which depend on economic fundamentals and real estate occupier market conditions. The differential prospects for real estate cash flows are the subject of the next section.;\n\nreal_estate_index:global-real-estate-markets-2023.pdf-!2:  Overall, we think that global capital values will bottom out in the second half of 2023, with the timing dependent upon how the economy fairs and a longer adjustment possible. 1 According to MSCI Global Quarterly Property Index and FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Index in USD. For example, owners who are forced to sell assets because they are unable to refinance debt or need to sell for other reasons, such as generating liquidity quickly. In such situations, sellers may be willing to accept below-market prices, or indeed have to, in order to facilitate a sale. For investors wanting to deploy capital now, holding off for a few months as pricing adjusts is probably the best strategy. Given the higher interest rate environment, we also think that floating rate real estate debt is an attractive way to achieve strong inflation protected returns and generate a good income return from real estate. Finally, looking across the globe, another potential opportunity for investors in 2023 is Japan, due to accretive hedging gains for investment into this market. Indeed, investors need to be mindful of large differences in monetary policy as interest rate differentials between countries determine the cost of hedging. Currently, Japan is particularly attractive on an after-hedging basis, since interest rates there are lower than in other markets. Page 3 of 8 What opportunities exist for investors in 2023? Which markets and sectors are the most defensive? There are two schools of thought in answering this question. One would argue that higher yielding assets offer greater value protection as they have a wider spread to the rising bond yields, and in some cases leverage can still be accretive. Yes, we think so. Japans economic recovery has lagged. The labor market improved in 2022, but is still soft relative to 2019. October inflation at 3.6 was the highest in four decades, but modest versus other countries. The pressure was also largely imported while domestic inflation stayed benign. In that context, maintaining the loose monetary policy appears the right thing to do. However, something has to give due to this diverging policy stance versus elsewhere.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, the commitment of the Bank of Japan to maintain near-zero interest rates does result in a fortified yen.

Every housing metric is indicating a softening, and builders are starting to recalibrate their business plans in the face of slowing demand. As the housing market resets, we should start to witness the true impact of the pan- demic on home design, location preferences, amenities, and financial preferences. How People Live Home offices and flex spaces are nothing new, but the desire for more functional spaces grew tremendously during the pan- demic-related lockdowns. Builders have not had time to create new designs, but they are modifying current ones. The CEO of a large private homebuilder noted that consumers prefer a higher bedroom count , so in many instances he is choosing existing plans with those features. His team also puts in reading nooks and drop zones where they can, often using space taken away from larger spaces. Architects are reporting similar adjustments. Three significant trends include the following:  More function in the same-sized home. Spaces added include an extra bedroom and additional flex or office spaces. To fit in the extra functions, architects are taking space from typically large areas like the kitchen or dining room and right-sizing the home office and making additional flex spaces that serve as additional work space.  Balance between public and private spacesopen great rooms are not going away. Instead, they are being paired with more private spaces like prep kitchens, drop zones, retreats, and nooks.  Outdoor spaces taking a larger share of space and home- owner spending. This often takes the form of nodessmall patios, decks, and balconies off the primary living areas instead of relying on one larger yard. Despite the overwhelming desire for outdoor and indoor space, density continues to rise as a way to improve affordability. Over 62 percent of architectural designers for production builders are working on denser projects in 2022, compared with only 10 percent with lower-density projects.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!27: 1 Changes to building codes over the past 10 years Sources: National Association of Home Builders. National Multifamily Housing Council. confidence suggests that that decline will likely continue until the interest rate environment turns more favorable. to a report from economists at the Fed, perhaps a reaction to lockdown claustrophobia. And the homes that do get built are expensive, particularly since the pandemic. Construction costs shot up due to supply chain disruptions and are still worrisome. As one housing industry adviser notes, Theres a stress index about global supply chains, and those stress indices are all indicating that theyre moderating, but theyre still at very high levels. Finally, high permitting fees and utility charges and large minimum lot sizes push developers to build more expensive homes. Renters Priced Out of the Homebuying Market With a growing share of households priced out of the for-sale market, demand for rental units is far outstripping new supply. Though population growth slowed sharply during the pandemic, demand is also rising from the many young adults eager to start their own households after moving back in with their parents during COVID. Further boosting demand is the increasing number of younger adults choosing to live alone, according The multifamily sector has responded with an unprecedented increase in new supply. Weve built more multifamily housing units over the last 10 years than we had in any other time since 1980, notes an adviser to institutional investors. But it is still far less than needed. Vacancies have fallen to their lowest levels ever while rents are rising faster than evereven faster than home prices. And though not a formal part of the affordability calculations, other housing-related costs like utilities and main- tenance are also rising faster than incomes, further constraining the ability of households to afford basic shelter. Moving to More Affordable Recent slowdowns in rent growth and home price appreciation, noted in our Normalizing trend, have done little to increase affordability. So how to address this? Millions of people have taken matters into their own hands.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!83:  One of the most suc- cessful active-adult brands in the United States has reported overwhelming demand for its cottage product1,200- to 1,400-square-foot homesand the builder is phasing out its Single-family renters who prefer to rent 35 Exhibit 2-8 Single-Family Renters: Preference to Own or Rent 35 Single-family renters who would prefer to own 65 Source: New Home Trends Institute by John Burns Real Estate Consulting LLC. Note: Data collected in April 2022 survey of 1,160 single-family renters with a household budget for rent of over $1,000. larger (65-foot-wide) lots. Buyers like the low maintenance and compact design of these homes. Technology also will affect the way people live, and faster than most people believe, according to the CEO of a national firm specializing in residential architecture. Homes have not changed significantly over the past few decades, and he believes there are aspirationalspeople who value time more than money and innovation over samenesswho are waiting on the sidelines for innovation. He is focused on designing the thoughtful home, infusing floor plans with performance capa- bilities that will save homeowners time, make life easier, and perhaps help homeowners live longer. Homebuilders are often willing to embrace new technology depending on the cost, but more often, buyers will choose their own technology after they purchase the home. Where People Live The pandemic brought massive migration across the United States as people reevaluated where they wanted to live based on cost, weather, community, and family. Builders noted the large number of Californians who moved to Florida, and also took note of apartment dwellers becoming homebuyers because they wanted yards. A large private builder in the South experienced the same and furthermore found that new in-migrants had suf- ficient cash for larger homes and more upgrades. The ability to work from home accelerated the migration. According to a 2022 John Burns New Home Trends Institute survey, only 49 percent of workers expect to come into the office every day versus 66 percent of workers who expected to come into the office every day prior to COVID.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!26:  One reason: existing tax laws are stacked against the individual homebuyer. Explains one academic, Investors are allowed to not only deduct everything, but also they can depreciate the unit. They also have access to lower cost of capital. In sum, institutional buyers assembling horizontal apartment portfolios can afford to pay more to be the high bidder for homes. And they do. Investors account for one in five homebuyers, up by a third compared with before the pandemic. Another supply constraint is homebuilders cautious construc- tion pacing, a vestige of the last recession. Explains the director of an investment institute who developed housing earlier in his career, A lot of the homebuilders, when the Great Recession happened, were stuck with inventory, said, Were not doing that again. Were going to build 10 new units, and as they sell, well start the next one, etc. And then labor shortages are compounding the problems. The construction sector as a whole hasnt returned to the peak we saw prior to the Great Recession. We saw a lot of that labor leave the sector for something maybe perceived more stable, says the economist for a housing advisory firm. All these factors are conspiring to limit housing construction far below population growth. In fact, the number of single-family housing starts in the last decade (20102019) relative to house- hold formations was the lowest since the government began tracking these trends and half as much or less than in preced- ing decades, despite the consistent increase in deliveries since bottoming in 2010. And now both permits and housing starts have been trending down again in 2022.

The global lodging sector proved resilient in 2021 and so far through 2022. Increasing access to vaccinations, government stimulus money, and general lockdown fatigue are generally credited with boosting leisure travel in the second half of the year. Global occupancy levels exceeded prepandemic levels in April and May of 2022. In late July, hotel occupancy in the United States topped 72, up 1 from last year, but still off 7 percentage points from 2019. Average daily room rates have paced to the third highest level on record to US$157. Outside of the United States, occupancies were 68, still down from a comparable week in 2019 of around 75. However, the daily average rate for room bookings is up 17 from 2019 to US$144.37 However, regional recoveries have varied. In general, areas dependent on leisure travel, such as Miami and the Maldives, have recovered more quickly than those reliant on business travel.38 Although, as of June, many people became more comfortable traveling54 of Deloittes consumer tracker survey respondents feel safe flying and 66 of respondents feel safe staying in a hotel, both record highs since data tracking began in April 2020. Near-term business travel expectations also increased with 64 of consumer survey respondents indicating they are likely to travel for business within the next 3 months, the highest points since coverage began.39 WHATS NEXT? Consumer spending is expected to shift from goods to services, which would benefit this sector.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!115:  While summer vacationing was a driver of strong hotel performance domestically for the second summer in a row, the return of inbound international travel will be a key driver in pro- pelling the lodging sectors recovery through the fall months, the holiday season, and into 2023 for top gateway cities. After recovery in smaller markets outpaced the top 25 markets in 2020 and 2021, the acceleration in performance has shifted back to the top 25. Performance in the top 25 markets is trend- ing upward, although recovery is uneven across these markets. According to CoStar, New York, Boston, and Los Angeles have experienced the most robust year-over-year recovery so far in 2022, while markets such as San Francisco substantially lag pre-pandemic performance levels. New York has benefited from increased demand in all areas, particularly the early stages of international and business travel in the first half of 2022, followed by international and domestic leisure over the summer months. Improvement in Los Angeles was propelled by a higher concentration of luxury rooms, which were able to maintain, or even exceed, pre-pandemic rates with less price-sensitive guests. Bostons demand resurgence took off in the second quarter of 2022, primarily driven by increased levels of leisure and group travel. CoStar reports that Bostons market RevPAR through the first half of 2022 reached 88 per- cent of 2019 levels. San Franciscos struggles have been primarily tied to slower recovery in international traffic and recent changes in the tech workforce, the citys primary industry. Prior to the pandemic, travelers from China made up the majority of San Franciscos international visitations. With nonessential overseas travel still banned in China as of the late September 2022 publication of this report, it is uncertain when San Francisco will experience the same benefits from inbound international traffic as other markets. The outlook for business traffic in San Francisco also is unclear, as the tech workforce has largely shifted to hybrid and remote working models.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!114:  Some people traveling for work have taken advantage of their new- found flexibility and now consider adding a few days, or even weeks, to their business trips to further explore a given destina- tion, whether it be on their own, with a significant other, or with family. Similarly, workers with the ability to work entirely remotely may choose to stay in a destination for an extended period and work from there. This may end up helping to offset any poten- tially permanent fallout from traditional business travel demand. Recovery in Top 25 Markets Hotels in highly dense urban markets experienced the greatest decline and slowest initial rebound during the downturn. The initial uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, and the govern- ments response, resulted in a dramatic shift in demand away from urban cores and toward drive-to leisure markets and resort destinations, which, as a result, rebounded the most quickly. With pandemic-related regulations and restrictions largely being phased out, urban markets are getting closer to fully reopened and experiencing recent surges in lodging demand, giving pric- ing power to the operators. So far, the resurgence in demand in these markets is attributed, in descending order, to leisure, group, and business travel. Inbound international travel has contributed to the recovery in several of the top 25 markets and is expected to play an even larger part in the recovery through the remainder of 2022 and into 2023. The U. S. Travel Association predicts that international arrivals will total 47.9 million by the end of 2022 and 65 million by the end of 2023, representing 60 and 82 percent of 2019 inbound international traffic levels, respectively. The increase in international arrivals in 2022 represents a 117 percent increase over 2021. Inbound international travel restrictions were lifted in early sum- mer 2022, but the resultant positive impact on inbound travel is not expected to really emerge until at least the fourth quarter of 2022.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!24:  Tourism is also picking up again. Although the number of overnight stays has not yet returned to 2019 levels, it is clearly gaining momentum. However, retailers are likely to be feeling the pain in the absence of high-spending Chinese customers. Because demographic growth came to a halt in 2020, the support which it provided for the retail sector in previous years is also la- cking.

Adjusted for inflation, the HDE expects sales to fall by 2 per cent in re- al terms. Real sales are thus already falling for the second year in succession.

But for now, the height- ened uncertainty is leading many players to stay on the sidelines as they wait to see where the market, particularly when it comes to pricing and valuations, settles. One interviewee noted their cautious approach when they said that they were sticking to the fairway, not trying to clear the trees and skip the dogleg, when it comes to deployment decisions. Cost Escalations amid Supply Chain Challenges and Labor Shortages On top of concerns about the capital markets are supply chain shortages and delays as well as significant increases in costs for labor and materials. Labor issues have been a challenge for some time, but rising costs and shortages of inputs including for key materials like steelhave added to the pressures. According to Statistics Canada, residential building costs were up 22.6 percent on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter of 2022.

And the homes that do get built are expensive, particularly since the pandemic. Construction costs shot up due to supply chain disruptions and are still worrisome. As one housing industry adviser notes, Theres a stress index about global supply chains, and those stress indices are all indicating that theyre moderating, but theyre still at very high levels. Finally, high permitting fees and utility charges and large minimum lot sizes push developers to build more expensive homes. Renters Priced Out of the Homebuying Market With a growing share of households priced out of the for-sale market, demand for rental units is far outstripping new supply. Though population growth slowed sharply during the pandemic, demand is also rising from the many young adults eager to start their own households after moving back in with their parents during COVID. Further boosting demand is the increasing number of younger adults choosing to live alone, according The multifamily sector has responded with an unprecedented increase in new supply. Weve built more multifamily housing units over the last 10 years than we had in any other time since 1980, notes an adviser to institutional investors. But it is still far less than needed. Vacancies have fallen to their lowest levels ever while rents are rising faster than evereven faster than home prices. And though not a formal part of the affordability calculations, other housing-related costs like utilities and main- tenance are also rising faster than incomes, further constraining the ability of households to afford basic shelter. Moving to More Affordable Recent slowdowns in rent growth and home price appreciation, noted in our Normalizing trend, have done little to increase affordability. So how to address this? Millions of people have taken matters into their own hands.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!88:  As supply begins to come online, rent growth is expected to deceleratefirst, in untested sub- markets with elevated pipelines. Higher-barrier locations, on the other hand, may sustain higher rent growth for longer. Construction Is Battling Supply Chain Issues Real estate developers across the United States are confronting rising construction costs. Steel, concrete, and roofing materials contribute up to 80 percent of typical shell costs. Market price surges since the end of 2019 for these, and other major catego- ries, caused finished construction costs to spike by 50 percent. Construction durations in the broader industry have increased by two to three months, on average, since 2019, due to lon- ger material lead times and increasing contractor backlogs, according to a construction director at a large industrial owner. Advanced material procurement strategies and construction technology can resolve some ongoing construction issues. Developers are moving upstream in the value chain by lever- aging direct partnerships with national material suppliers to pre-secure and prioritize long-lead building materials and mitigate material shortages where possible. Developers are also introducing modularized construction systems to expedite repeatable project elements, such as office tenant improve- ments and in-warehouse restrooms, which reduce on-site construction timelines.

Adaptation Key as the Landscape Shifts for Canadian Real Estate What does this mean for real estate companies? For some, it adds further to the need to take a pause on activity. There have been rising projections, for example, of developers delaying or potentially canceling condo projects as it becomes harder to make the numbers work in these challenging conditions. Others are trying to manage this by spacing out advanced sales of new housing units to ensure that prices reflect rising costs as a project moves forward.

While challenging, an environment like this also presents opportu- nities. Companies with less leverage may be able to secure assets at more reasonable prices. And while some sources of financing may be less available than in the past, many interviewees predict that the private debt market will help fill some of the gap. The pause in the market is also a chance to explore solutions to some of the challenges that builders are facing. Some interviewees, for example, touted mass timber as a potential opportunity to get projects built faster, which is key in an environment of rising costs. 2. ESG Performance: A Critical Issue for Canadian Real Estate You can do ESG, and you can get a return. Alternative materials like mass timber also offer important sustainability benefits, which brings us to another critical issue for Canadas real estate industry: ESG performance. There are many factors underpinning the ESG imperative, but a few issues in particular are driving the increased focus for real estate companies now. Key among them is the ability to attract capital.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, concerns over supply chain issues are contributing to elevated costs in the housing construction industry.

S. commercial property markets actually embarked on a remarkable run, with some of the strongest returns, rent growth, and price appreciation rates ever recorded. Not every property type, however: hotels endured their worst and most sustained downturn in memory, while offices suffered an unprecedented and significant cut in usage of space. And not every market: some of the nations strongest gateway mar- kets, like New York City and San Francisco, experienced sharp outflows of residents, businesses, and tenants of all types. But overall and across much of the United States, property markets far outperformed expectations and historical norms. And now, more than two years on, property investors and managers are learning anew that whopping growth and profits eventually fall back to eartha reversion to the mean, to use finance jargon, or simply normalizing, as numerous industry experts we interviewed put it. Some looming market adjustments will be cyclical due to the weakening economic conditions that most economists and real estate professionals expect, while others represent more of a return to normalcy after all the pandemic-fueled market distortions. These market reversions will take several forms: prices of most assets are declining as cap rates rise and transaction volumes fall from record levels, while rent gains for others are merely moderating as demand returns to more sustainable levels. Perhaps the biggest surprise is that these reversals of fortune are hitting favored property sectors like multifamily and indus- trial. That does not necessarily mean the market corrections will be painful. In many cases, recent losses in property value will only trim already healthy gains. But many indicators suggest that the (really) good times may be over, at least for a while. Housing Set to Cool A finance executive with one national homebuilder told us, Were still selling. Its just not at the pace that it was selling before the last two years, which was a pace that you dont typi- cally see. So, the markets are more normalizing.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!13:  More than half believe that capitalization rates are heading up next year and returns are coming down, primarily due to rising interest rates and cost of capital, which was the top economic concern voiced in our survey. After more than a decade of lower for longer, the Fed is finally normalizing interest rates closer to historical levels. Those rising interest rates are already driving up debt costs and thus the costs to acquire and develop property, reducing leveraged returns. At the same time, the federal government is done with providing stimulus, indirectly reducing tenant demand for space. Unlike in the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and during the pandemic, nobodys coming to the rescue, and now we got to take our medicine, and here it comes, says the head of research for an investment management firm. Thus, the government is turning off both the monetary and fiscal spigots that had been support- ing commercial real estate and the economy overall. The head of a development company summarized it like this: I feel like weve been on a little bit of a sugar high with this stimu- lus and cheap debt. Theres going to be a slowdown. Theres got to be this normalization. So, what does that mean? I think its going to be a little bouncy. Its going to be a little bit turbulent. But then we bottom out, and we start back into growth. 2.  Still, Weve Changed Some  The pandemic forced structural shifts in how and where we live, work, and recreate in ways that seem destinated to endure.  Online spending is receding from its pandemic peaks but is not likely to revert to pre-pandemic levels. Business travel is unlikely to recover to pre-COVID levels for at least several years, meaning business hotels, fine dining, and conference facilities will continue to face challenges.  The greatest changes may be in how and where we work. The impact on office use and leasing is still evolving, and a significant share of the existing stock may need to be reposi- tioned to remain competitive.;\n\nreal_estate_index:global-real-estate-markets-2023.pdf-!1:  We also dive into student housing in the US, another sector booming among investors, and what impact demographic trends might have on it. In addition, we analyze how opportunistic and value-add managers will need to adopt their strategies now that interest rates are higher, and how their ability to generate out-size returns simply by adding leverage is gone. So, a number of important topics for us and investors to consider. We hope you find our answers insightful and useful in determining your strategy and thinking about some of the key questions in real estate as we move into the new year. Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy. Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs. We have already started to see cap rates and yields rise in many markets, with the most rapid adjustment taking place in the UK. However, we do not think that prices fully reflect higher interest rates yet. To assess when values might bottom out, we can look to past downturns and the listed market for guidance. In the Global Financial Crisis, for example, global capital values bottomed out in 4Q09, while GDP across global real estate markets troughed three quarters earlier, in 1Q09, as did global listed real estate prices1. Market downturns usually present opportunities, and one we expect for investors in 2023 is a correction in pricing as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. Although we do not expect large amounts of distress in the market, we do expect some, already apparent in parts of the UK market. This should allow investors access to assets at attractive pricing. The early 1990s downturn was longer, with US capital values continuing to decline into 1995. We expect modest declines in GDP in the first half of 2023 before growth resumes.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!7:  Declines in consumer confidence over the last year have been even sharper. All of these positive and negative factors together paint a kind of a Rorschach test, where observers can draw their own conclusions as to the strength of the economy. The End of the Beginning But there is one issue on which our interviewees agree: The exis- tential risk for the real estate economy right now is that Fed action in response to persistent inflation will tip us into a recession, says a senior partner with a leading advisory firm. But can the Federal Reserve Bank tame inflation without breaking the economy? Moderating inflation rates this summer led many to believe that the worst was over and that the Fed could soon ease up its con- tractionary monetary policy. Indeed, the consensus of experts we interviewed this summer was that the Fed would cease tightening by the end of 2022 and start cutting rates again in mid-2023. That sentiment now appears optimistic. Inflation is going to be a little stickier than people think, said an investment banking executive we interviewed during the summer, whose views turned out to be more prescient. Sentiment started changing in late August when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell gave his annual speech to fellow central bankers affirming the Fed view that infla- tion is not nearly under control, jolting markets. Any remaining doubt about that was quashed by the official Fed commentary accompanying their September rate announcement projecting that rates would keep rising through 2023. As Winston Churchill famously cautioned after the British army won a critical WWII battle, the victory marked not the end, not even the beginning of the end, but, possibly, the end of the beginning. 4 Higher for Longer With interest rates headed higher for longer, the risk of a deeper, full-fledged recession is rising, according to a grow- ing consensus of economists. In an August 2022 survey by the National Association of Business Economics, only a quarter of economists were even somewhat confident that the Fed could bring down inflation to its target range without causing a recession. Worrying signs out of Europe in early autumn and expectations of soaring heating bills this coming winter add to the gloomy global economic outlook.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, the United States property market has begun a period of normalization after an extraordinary growth phase, beginning in 2010 and ending in 2022 when the Fed started hiking interest rates. According to  and , prices of most assets are declining as cap rates rise and transaction volumes fall from record levels, while rent gains for others are merely moderating as demand returns to more sustainable levels. In addition,  states that it takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns, and that we have already started to see cap rates and yields rise in many markets, with the most rapid adjustment taking place in the UK. Furthermore,  states that the Fed action in response to persistent inflation will tip us into a recession, and that the consensus of experts we interviewed this summer was that the Fed would cease tightening by the end of 2022 and start cutting rates again in mid-2023. However, this sentiment now appears optimistic as inflation is going to be a little stickier than people think.\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

Schumpeters viewpoints were shaped by being an escapee of both the rise of fascism in 1930s Germany and of Soviet-style communism of the 1950sregimes that came to power through sham elections. Like the 2525 video, reading Schumpeter reminds us how the past, present and future all intersect. Geopolitical events in LaSalles target countries are as difficult to predict as the idiosyncratic motivations of their leaders. As researchers, we cannot know the future, but we can help devise strategies to cope with whatever alternative futures may arise. The forces of nationalism, authoritarianism and a distrust of globalism may represent a temporary triumph of politics over economics. Over the long term, though, the power of open markets remains a force to be reckoned with and not to be underestimated. Likewise, well-constructed and well-located properties can thrive even during periods of great political turmoil. Successful real estate investing rests on identification of timeless attributes that are successful over the course of several cycles. These attributes must be appropriately priced and they must also adapt to trends in demographics, technology, urbanization and environmental factors. This triangle of timelessness, adaptation and fair value pricing forms the foundation for successful real estate investing. As I hand over the reins of LaSalles research to a new generation of researchers, I sense that the past, present and future will continue to intersect and to overlap. The awarding of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Economics was based in part on an analysis of the Great Depression of the 1930s. We have learned much about credit cycles and the role of banks in maintaining or losing confidence in market institutions. At the same time, the events of 2022 in Ukraine and elsewhere show how unpredictable the course of human events can be. The semi-predictable path of rising C02 levels is leading to weather volatility along with rising atmospheric and oceanic temperatures.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!13: 0 G LO BA L A S I A PAC I F I C E U R O P E N O R T H A M E R I CA G LO BA L - 1 The math of spiking interest rates is driving a repricing of real estate In a completely efficient market, real estate pricing should be closely linked to that of the other asset classes that make up the broader investable universe. Investors should receive similar ex ante returns for similar risks, or else any free lunches will be arbitraged away. In practice, private market real estate pricing tends to be impacted by broader capital market shifts mainly when there are changes in the cost of real estate debt, since the marginal buyer of income-producing real estate is most often a leveraged buyer. When debt costs rise, the market thins before price pressures are reflected in transactions. This tends to create a time lag between higher interest rates and declines in private equity real estate pricing. In most markets globally, we are now feeling the impact of more expensive real estate debt, which in many cases is no longer accretive to returns at current private market valuations. The math of debt costs and going-in yields is relentless. When the yield starting point is especially low in absolute terms, modest increases in debt costs and yields as measured in basis points mathematically translate into big percentage changes in capital values. As such, evidence of the most significant repricing to date has been concentrated in the lowest- yielding sectors, where transactions have held up most. This has surprised some observers since these low-yielding property types are mostly the winning sectors of recent years and they continue to possess attractive growth profiles. That some of the largest recent value declines may be occurring in the most sought- after property types, such as logistics and residential, might come as a shock after years of banner outperformance, especially during the pandemic. Even so, these property types remain the strongest performers over longer trailing periods and values have also fallen in the less favored sectors, although such adjustments are masked by lower price transparency in these property types. This repricing has been labeled mechanical by some because it is a function of exogenous debt assumptions increasing in investors spreadsheets.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!14:  An alternative way to look at it is that it is mechanical because debt pricing is a mechanism by which real estate is linked to the broader capital markets, through lenders cost of funds. Another such mechanism is the denominator effect. This involves comparing real-time values from public markets to lagging valuation-based assessments of private market portfolios, causing some investors to conclude that they are suddenly overweight in the unlisted assets compared to their target allocation. Either way, the downward direction of the pricing pressure is clear and it will likely persist as long as the all-in cost of debt is dilutive to leveraged returns. Given the same inputs, the math works the same way all over the world. But today those inputs to the math vary greatly, depending on local circumstances. In Japan, debt costs have moved far less than in other parts of the world, as inflation remains subdued and the Bank of Japan continues to exercise yield curve control . By contrast, Europes real estate yield starting point was exceptionally low and market interest rates have moved up much more markedly, making the math that much more impactful. Government policy also matters. As central banks seek to choke off inflation by tightening monetary policy, there is at least the reasonable expectation that some of that inflation will be passed into rents and thus property cash flows. But when governments employ long-term borrowing to bail out energy consumers in the short term, as is necessary in Europe, interest rates are pushed up further and the impact on property values may be more detrimental. As the UKs recent experience would suggest, credit markets can react swiftly to reflect changes in perceived debt sustainability.

Technology, which has expanded every year as proptech applications have revolutionized the management and valuation tools used by practitioners. Prospective: In the year 2025 The lessons of the early 1990s are clear: real estate down-cycles do not last forever. Reflecting on the frightening memories of plummeting values, empty buildings, bankruptcies and the Resolution Trust Corporation , suggests that the current round of credit tightening is likely to pale in comparison. The 2023 edition of LaSalles ISA Outlook anticipates the impacts of the rising cost of credit, a stall in economic growth and a pause in the multi-decade pattern of real estate appreciation. However, it does not extrapolate these trends far into the future. The human tendency to latch onto a few pieces of information and to expect that a narrow set of recent facts will shape future events is known as anchoring bias. When investing in a long-duration asset class like real estate, a longer-term, holistic view is more valuable. In 2014, the apocalyptic visions of German film director, Fritz Langs 1927 masterpiece Metropolis were put alongside the 1960s rock song 2525. The irony of bringing together dark images from one era, while listening to music from another, through the technology of a more recent YouTube artist is symbolic of how imperfectly clever we are at predicting the future. The eerily weird Lang-2525 juxtaposition implicitly illustrates how resilient humanity can be, even while contemplating what seem like existential threats such as fascism, industrialization and robots in the 1920s, nuclear holocausts in the 1960s. Financial panics in the 1990s and again in 2008-2010 and climate change and geopolitical conflict in the 2020s. Josef Schumpeter is most well-remembered for popularizing the term creative destruction. He is less remembered for his work on democratic theory. To Schumpeter, democracy is the mechanism for competition among political parties in a market- like framework.;\n***\n[Submission]: Answer: Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that deals with the behavior of particles on an atomic and subatomic level.

Wealth tends to be concentrated in larger urban centres with better employment opportunities where the average age of the working population is lower than in regional and more remote communities. Demand for living assets remains strong in most urbanised areas due to demographic growth and the rising number of households, boosted by immigration and the expanding number of younger and older people living alone. The volume of new housing developments is also falling due to increasingly stringent environmental rules, shortages of materials and rising labour costs. Demand continues to outstrip supply, especially in the affordable segment. If the number of new-build projects continues to decline, the valuations of existing stock may hold up relatively well. Increases in mortgage rates mean home ownership will move out of reach of a growing group of people, forcing them to turn to the rental market for accommodation that fits their budgets. Residential real estate is seen as a relatively good inflation hedge as most rental contracts are index-linked but, in our view, it will not be possible to pass on the full level of consumer price rises to tenants. Governments in many countries are implementing measures to offset energy price hikes or cap rental increases to support the purchasing power of people living in social housing and other low- to middle-income tenants. Rising 10-year government bond yields will simultaneously pressure spread levels and yields will move out. This is demonstrated in the graph below which tracks the expected development of residential net initial yields against 10-year government bond levels for the leading European gateway cities.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!19:  One of our key themes last year was Everyone Wants In, reflecting the deep and wide investor demand for just about every type of real estate, except central business district (CBD) office and regional malls. Sales volumes jumped to over $800 billion in 2021, according to MSCI Real Assetsalmost double the depressed total in the first pandemic year of 2020 and nearly one-third more than the prior $600 billion record reached in 2019. The surge continued into 2022, with sales volumes in the first half of the year up 38 percent over the same period last year, as even the sharp rise in interest rates did little to dampen transaction volumes. But these recent volumes do not tell the whole storyand the story they do tell may be misleading as to where property markets seem to be heading. Discussions with numerous participants from all corners of the industry confirm that many investors have moved to the sidelinesor to other types of assets like equities and bonds. Indeed, the recent surge may well reflect a last gasp to get deals done before the expected increase in interest rates. Fewer Investors Fewer investors and lenders will be providing capital for assets, according to this years Emerging Trends survey: expectations of availability declined for every one of the 13 equity and debt capital sources. Over the past decade, CRE markets benefited from a substantial capital inflow as alternative investment classes have gained wider acceptance and real estate offered compel- ling risk-adjusted returns. Now, some of those inflows look to reverse. Investor interest is still healthy, but not what it was. Instead of seven or 10 competing offers for sale, theres now two or three, which I think thats normal, says the head of an investment firm. Thats normalizing, too. Several forces look to restrict investor demand, starting with the lower expected returns discussed in our Normalizing trend. Rising interest rates are making acquisition and construc- tion debt more expensive, just when operating incomes seem destined to slide as the economy weakens in the forecasted downturn. Indeed, the prospect of lower income and higher costs is breaking deals, as buyers either seek price breaks or pull out altogether.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!71:  Class A property investments align with rent-by-choice higher- income households and a swelling population of aging Americans ready to downsize and simplify. B and C value-add investments suit a growing market of younger and mid-career households stuck in the limbo of scarce supply, high prices, and high interest mortgages that will delay their becoming homeowners. Closing a gaping, and widening, chasm in new investment and development would well serve households in the 80 to 120 percent range of area median household income levels the wage range of many essential workers such as teachers, sanitation workers, law enforcement officers, and fire and medical first responders. Furthermore, addressing this missing middle household income level does not preclude the need for additions to and preservation of properties for lower-income households. The Great Bottleneck: Local Ballot Boxes Apartment stakeholders number-one nemesis, blocking private- sector market solutions to deep and growing mismatches between demand and supply, is a many-headed hydraa bevy of deep-rooted restrictive land use, permitting, and regulatory cost burdens that thwart higher-density multifamily develop- ment. On top of these longstanding challenges, a growing push for rent regulation is adding uncertainty to the market. For example, while 26 states prohibit local municipalities from implementing rent control laws, five states permit localities to enforce rent controlNew York, New Jersey, California, Oregon, and Marylandas well as Washington, D. C. Regulations being proposed throughout the country would allow landlords to boost monthly rents by no more than 2 percent to 10 percent. Arizona, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, Washington, and Massachusetts have all introduced proposals to add or expand rent control protections. The problem of impact fees and NIMBYism really dominates many markets and makes it too expensive to develop, the CEO of one of the nations largest property management organizations says. I think were still stuck in the past. Some policymakers are not in tune. Voters who may not be well versed in these issues elect government officials who then become a huge wall to economic solutions. I dont see solutions for all this happening in my lifetime.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!30:  In the end, perhaps the most effective solution is the most obvi- ous: we must construct more housing that is affordable to more people. As the former homebuilder we quoted earlier puts it, what is needed is a new way of getting housing out there and get it built more affordably. 15 5. Give Me Quality, Give Me Niche Investment demand for commercial real estate assets is still healthy, if more tentative, as discussed in Capital Moving to the Sidelinesor to Other Assets. But real estate capital markets are also becoming more bifurcated between the favored and the scorned as investors, lenders, and developers turn more selective than they have been in recent years. What assets will find love and capitalin the coming years? Investors and developers seem to be preferring three distinct types of opportunities:  The security of major product types with the strongest demand fundamentals, notably industrial and multifamily housing, which essentially tie for top investment ratings in this years Emerging Trends survey.  Best-quality assets in sectors undergoing significant demand disruption, especially retail and office. And  Narrowly targeted subsectors and newer niche asset types . There is much less appetite now for riskier opportunistic invest- ments. Our survey also confirms continuing strong interest in Sun Belt markets, though the rankings are moderately tighter than last year, as we show in our markets review in chapter 3. Hot or Not? The dominant capital market trend is the increasing divergence of demand among different property types and then within property types, particularly office. As investors get more selective, they increasingly choose safer sectors with the most compelling market fundamentals. Tenant demand continues to outpace the markets capacity to add new supply in both the residential and industrial sectors, which therefore draw the greatest interest from capital markets. Retail and office, by contrast, find much less support. We repeatedly heard some version of that story in interviews with industry leaders. But that big picture does not fully capture the range of market currents. Tenant and investor demand for apartments and warehouses is deep at all price points and almost every market, but the story is more nuanced for office and retail.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, there is an upswing in the market for investments that increase property value, especially among the younger and middle-aged demographic.

National Multifamily Housing Council. confidence suggests that that decline will likely continue until the interest rate environment turns more favorable. to a report from economists at the Fed, perhaps a reaction to lockdown claustrophobia. And the homes that do get built are expensive, particularly since the pandemic. Construction costs shot up due to supply chain disruptions and are still worrisome. As one housing industry adviser notes, Theres a stress index about global supply chains, and those stress indices are all indicating that theyre moderating, but theyre still at very high levels. Finally, high permitting fees and utility charges and large minimum lot sizes push developers to build more expensive homes. Renters Priced Out of the Homebuying Market With a growing share of households priced out of the for-sale market, demand for rental units is far outstripping new supply. Though population growth slowed sharply during the pandemic, demand is also rising from the many young adults eager to start their own households after moving back in with their parents during COVID. Further boosting demand is the increasing number of younger adults choosing to live alone, according The multifamily sector has responded with an unprecedented increase in new supply. Weve built more multifamily housing units over the last 10 years than we had in any other time since 1980, notes an adviser to institutional investors. But it is still far less than needed. Vacancies have fallen to their lowest levels ever while rents are rising faster than evereven faster than home prices. And though not a formal part of the affordability calculations, other housing-related costs like utilities and main- tenance are also rising faster than incomes, further constraining the ability of households to afford basic shelter. Moving to More Affordable Recent slowdowns in rent growth and home price appreciation, noted in our Normalizing trend, have done little to increase affordability. So how to address this? Millions of people have taken matters into their own hands.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!29:  So far, migra- tion from the highest-priced markets has not been enough to actually reduce housing costs in those markets, though costs generally are rising more slowly there. Demographics and the slowing economy could also help ease the housing imbalance. The nations population is growing at its slowest pace ever, thanks to both low birth and immigration rates. And fewer buyers are on the hunt for homes now due to affordability and concerns about possible job losses in a recession. The good news is that it is an opportunity for home- builders and land developers to do a little catch-up. Theyve been running behind for two years, and they may actually welcome a little respite to finish the homes that they have sold, thinks a senior adviser to many homebuilders. But these favorable trends alone will not be nearly enough to solve the affordability quandary. What else would help? As we outlined in previous editions of Emerging Trendswhen hous- ing was less expensive than it is nowthere are no easy fixes, but several obvious policy options would help: notably, lowering the many obstacles to housing construction, decreasing rising regulatory costs , and expediting approvals. Technology can play a bigger role in actually delivering homes by helping bring innovation and cost efficiencies to a sector that has been notoriously slow to change. Most notable are different approaches to prefabricated and modular housing in which much or all of the house is built in a factory and then assembled on the homesite. These methods can dramatically reduce the need for labor and shrink production times at more affordable costs. Promising innovations are also arising from the nascent single-fam- ily build-to-rent sector, which is learning how to scale construction and design to reduce costs and development time, as explained in our single-family sector overview found in chapter 2. Government could also expand affordable housing produc- tion. Unfortunately, Congress dropped the affordable housing components of the proposed Build Back Better Act from what became the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, meaning that no additional federal help is on the way. But many state and local governments are stepping into the breach, as we discuss in our final trend on regulation.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!68:   Two, demand gathered speed and sweep as people sought larger living spaces to balance remote work and household life, and more outdoor living options.

Inflated property valuations, com- pressed cap rates, and a sea change from individual owners to medium and large-sized corporate owners became a new norm seemingly overnight. This time period veers wildly from a steady slope of otherwise well-entrenched trends across the structural demand front. Operational modernization kicked into super-fast-forward mode toward self-service, and a robust new-development pipeline at least. According to a recent Bloomberg report, After dipping in 2020, the number of new units authorized in multifamily build- ings took off, running 37 percent higher over the past 12 months as of June 2022 than in the same period in 20182019. As of August, 862,000 apartments were under construction, up 25 percent from a year ago. At the same time, COVIDs aftermath sharply defined conflicting forceswhich together destine virtually all of Americas newly developed and built apartment communities for a financially privileged professional class. Rather than causing an expansion of rental housing stock, however, higher-income households come-lately demand for rental neighborhoods instead served to crowd out moderate- and lower-income households in supply- constrained areas. Its been virtually impossible to build affordable, says the chief executive of one of the apartment industry trade groups.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!179:  Another interviewee emphasized the need for more collaborative partnerships among industry players, nonprofit organizations, and governments to deliver affordable hous- ing. There are many examples of creative partnerships and approaches to building affordable homes in Canada that, with the right funding and incentives from governments, can make a difference if applied more broadly. Labor Shortages Amplifying the Affordability Challenge The other key issue is that even with better, more consistent, and more collaborative programs and policies focused on supply, labor shortages will impede significant progress on building more housing. As we noted, one of the big factors increasing development costs relates to the tight labor market, and demo- graphic trends mean that that issue is not going away. While much has been made of the so-called great resignation and the notion that many Canadians are reevaluating their relation- ship with the workplace in the wake of the pandemic, Statistics Canada has shown that the labor force participation rate by those in the core-age cohort remains in line with pre-pandemic trends. One factor con- tributing to the tight labor market is retirements by those older than the core-age cohort, and with Canadas population aging, we can expect these demographic trends to add to the chal- lenges experienced by sectors like the construction industry. So, what can we do about this? A key action is to heed calls in reports like the one from Ontarios housing affordability task force to change immigration criteria to prioritize skilled-trades workers. Promoting the trades and attracting people from under- represented and marginalized groups to work in this area also will help relieve these challenges over time. far short of what is necessary. For one, new funding to incentiv- ize affordable housing is good, but it is not enough to make a serious dent in the problem. And without more consistent criteria around what we mean when we talk about affordability and affordable housing and how to tailor initiatives for groups with different needssuch as homeless Canadians, the working poor, and middle-income householdspolicies and programs will fail to address them effectively. Governments also need to acknowledge the ways that their actions hinder affordability by adding significant costs onto the construction of new housing.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, the limitations in new housing production are attributed to workforce scarcity and builders' prudent construction speed .\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

Meanwhile, apartment rents have continued to push ever higher, but the pace has been moderating in recent months. Construction starts also have slowed. The National Association of Home Builders housing market index has fallen for eight straight months through August 2022 to its lowest level since May 2020. This is not to say that were in a housing recessionfar from it. Homes are still selling at a healthy rate by historical levels, and home prices remain near record levels. And while multifamily vacancies are at their lowest level in four decades and rents continue to log new records every month, the rates of increase have been slowing and are expected to decelerate further, according to many experts we interviewed. Maybe you dont see the 10 percentplus rent growth in multifamily markets, says the head of one institutional investment advisory firm. They should come back to more of a long-term historical average of 3 percent to 4 percent, and maybe offset some of the unafford- ability in the country. Indeed, housing markets may be partly victims of their own success as record prices and rents mean fewer households can afford to buy homes or rent apartments, particularly with mort- gage interest rates and housing-related expenses like utilities 6 rising sharplya topic we explore in Too Much for Too Many, our trend on housing affordability. The Amazon Pause The white-hot industrial market also seems set to cool after sev- eral years of unprecedented demand growth and rent gains that have pushed rents far above prior records. Growth in e-com- merce is slowing and giving back some of the market share it captured from physical retailers during the pandemic. Amazon, the largest warehouse user in the United States, has delayed occupying numerous completed projects, trying to sublet many, as it slows its physical growthwhat some are calling the Amazon pause. Other major retailers also have been cutting back their distribution expansion plans. To be sure, the industrial sector still enjoys record-low vacancy rates, as demand for high-quality, well-located logistics facilities has been running ahead of the markets ability to supply them.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!89: 0 7.0 0 20 40 60 80 100 Source: Emerging Trends in Real Estate 2023 survey.

Rents would have to rise sharply to cover construction costs and higher interest rates 45 The impact on building projects is illustrated by a survey of members carried out by the GdW. Around two thirds of members are planning to shelve new build renovation projects for the time being. Around one quarter are planning to give up new building projects altogether. Around 13 per cent intend to abstain from renovation projects. Bearing in mind the time it takes to complete building projects, the number of flat completions could fall noticeably from 2024 onwards, thus compounding the short- age of available flats. Urgently needed work to retrofit the existing housing stock is also stalling. Residential rents continued to rise in 2022 as well Residential rents in top locations continued to rise in 2022. On average, they rose by around 2.5 per cent yoy across the seven cities. This means a more moderate rate than the average annual rent rise of over 4 per cent in the last ten years. This slower rent rise is likely to be related to already high rents and moreover to the fact that the population growth has come to a halt. Moreover, the level of initial rents is also being dampened by an improvement in supply through a rise in the number of completions. Unlike in previous years from 2010 onwards, rents have risen slower than inflation since the end of 2021. At the half-way point in 2022, the average initial rent in top locations ranged from EUR 13.80 per m2 in Dsseldorf to EUR 20.80 per m2 in Munich. The average initial rent across the seven cities was around EUR 16.50 per m2. It rose by over 50 per cent over ten years. By comparison, the average rent for re-lets is EUR 13.70 per m2. In this case, the ten-year percentage increase is in line with that of initial rents.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, according to  and , as of August, 862.000 apartments were under construction, up 25 percent from a year ago.\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

Schumpeters viewpoints were shaped by being an escapee of both the rise of fascism in 1930s Germany and of Soviet-style communism of the 1950sregimes that came to power through sham elections. Like the 2525 video, reading Schumpeter reminds us how the past, present and future all intersect. Geopolitical events in LaSalles target countries are as difficult to predict as the idiosyncratic motivations of their leaders. As researchers, we cannot know the future, but we can help devise strategies to cope with whatever alternative futures may arise. The forces of nationalism, authoritarianism and a distrust of globalism may represent a temporary triumph of politics over economics. Over the long term, though, the power of open markets remains a force to be reckoned with and not to be underestimated. Likewise, well-constructed and well-located properties can thrive even during periods of great political turmoil. Successful real estate investing rests on identification of timeless attributes that are successful over the course of several cycles. These attributes must be appropriately priced and they must also adapt to trends in demographics, technology, urbanization and environmental factors. This triangle of timelessness, adaptation and fair value pricing forms the foundation for successful real estate investing. As I hand over the reins of LaSalles research to a new generation of researchers, I sense that the past, present and future will continue to intersect and to overlap. The awarding of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Economics was based in part on an analysis of the Great Depression of the 1930s.

Cheshire Oaks Ellesmere Port, UK Europe has an opportunity to accentuate its already world-leading position in climate-driven infrastructure. Though diversification among fossil fuel suppliers is certainly an objective, diversifying energy sources to further incorporate wind, solar and hydroelectric will pay dividends for the blocs attempts to meet net zero carbon goals. These activities will also support specific real estate investment opportunities, such as incorporating on-site renewables. Real estate fundamentals holding up Capital markets stresses, not the lack of demand from occupiers to relocate, expand or upgrade their space, define the current crisis. Despite the extensive market uncertainty, many European occupier markets continue to show surprisingly robust activity, at least so far. The key to this has been a combination of occupiers playing catch-up post-pandemic, long- standing shortages of certain kinds of stock, tightening limitations on land use and supply discipline driven by developers and their lenders. Office take-up in the first three quarters of 2022 has been 6.7 above the five-year average, according to JLL. European office vacancy rates have remained below the long-term average of 7.5, with many markets posting vacancy rates still comfortably below their natural rates of vacancy , as shown in Exhibit EU.4. Sentiment can turn quickly, however. Office users continue to contend with uncertainty around how much and what sort of space they will require in the long term. As we suggest in the global section of this report, a stable balance of in-person and virtual interaction may have been reached, but long leases and wait-and-see attitudes mean we do not yet have clarity on sustainable levels of office demand.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!45:  There are deep geopolitical changes underway, including a shift away from Russian fossil fuels, with opportunities for a step-change in the adoption of renewable sources of energy. There will likely also be lasting ramifications for the project of European integration, with outcomes depending on whether European nation-states decide to share the burden or go it alone. It may also reset relations between governments and their people, whose expectations for state intervention to avert negative economic outcomes have rarely been higher. Sharing challenges like inflation, climate change, currency stability, Russian aggression, refugee relief and energy policy may realign UK and EU policies to a greater degree than at any time since the Brexit vote. In real estate terms, the major markets of Europe are highly varied. Yet, when viewed from a global perspective, they are quite like one another in terms of their focus on green building policies, reliance on public transport, cautious approach to new supply and their proximity to an armed conflict. ISA Outlook 2023 38 ISA Outlook 2023 39 G LO BA L A S I A PAC I F I C E U R O P E N O R T H A M E R I CA An unwelcome external shock Russias invasion of Ukraine came at a time when Europe was already embroiled in an economic struggle on multiple fronts. The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated huge government fiscal interventions to support consumers and businesses through periods of mandated closure. These came on the heels of a decade in which sovereign debt crises and austerity had already seen productivity growth stagnate without meaningfully improving sovereign balance sheets in peripheral Europe. Reopening as the pandemic entered the endemic phase saw supply chain stresses and uneven demand patterns drive shortfalls in the availability of goods and labor. The energy supply crunch resulting from European support for Ukraine added a huge exogenous cost shock to the existing global and regional price pressure, driving European inflation readings to the highest level in the world by the end of 2022, on top of the future costs of new commitments to defense spending. The war in Ukraine will eventually end, but barring an unexpected change in Russian leadership, the deflationary impact of its cheap natural gas to heat homes and power industry will not return.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!32:  LOOKING AHEAD  The European energy crisis shows how quickly energy efficiency can move from being nice to have to an economic imperative. The rest of the world is not in the same situation as Europe, but its experience shows that conditions can change quickly and it is better to prepare for the future than to be simply reactive.  Physical climate risk must be managed at two levels: at the portfolio level, through assessment of exposure concentrations and consideration of how climate risk informs overall portfolio construction strategies. And at the property level, through evaluating both existing and potential new hardening strategies to be more resilient against particular hazards.  Incremental investments in hardening against physical climate change, increasing energy efficiency and installing on-site renewables may, in certain situations and especially for existing portfolio assets in Europe, offer one of the most attractive risk-adjusted returns on capital available today.  The transition to a decarbonized world also brings nonphysical transition risks that tend to be specific to local markets. These include changes in insurance availability and costs, regulations, taxes, incentives, and changes in tenant and capital market demand.  For a deeper dive on the energy transition and how it relates to real estate strategies, have a look at LaSalles November 2022 report Decarbonization and the Evolution to Net Zero Carbon Real estate.

Its two largest economies, Japan and China, are seeing stable or loosening monetary policies as the rest of the world tightens. Meanwhile, monetary conditions in the smaller economies in the region closely resemble the dynamics in Western nations.  Key uncertainties include whether the Bank of Japan can continue to keep long-yields low and the prospects for China ending its COVID-Zero regime.  Real estate capital market activity in the region has remained relatively resilient, owing to the dominance of intra-regional and domestic capital flows.;\n\nreal_estate_index:bouwinvest_international-market-outlook_2023-2025-1.pdf-!0: Real Estate Outlook 2023-2025 Challenging times ahead Table of contents Table of contents Executive Summary Europe North America Asia Pacific Contact 3 4 12 20 29 Bouwinvest Outlook 2023-2025 2 Executive Summary Global Real Estate at Crossroads During the three-year period through 2025, Europe will be characterised by slower economic growth, higher interest rates and elevated uncertainty. The tightening - or even negative - spread between real estate yields and government bond yields - a proxy for the risk-free rate - will lead to asset repricing across Europe, potentially generating opportunities for non-leveraged investors. Residential and logistics real estate markets continue to be better placed than offices and retail due to fundamental occupier demand drivers, while niche segments generate interesting opportunities. In the U. S. the southern sunbelt states are expected to outshine other parts of the country due to migration patterns, a tax-friendly environment, expanding workforce and greater affordability. Various niche sectors across North America, including data centres, life science and medical office buildings, self-storage, and manufactured housing, are already quite mature and point to the way forward for the future development of real estate markets elsewhere in the world. Within the heterogenous Asia-Pacific region, Australia is cementing its status as a safe haven. Singapore, meanwhile, is expected to see its relative attractiveness increase versus Hong Kong while a zero-Covid-19 policy, a troubled property sector and geopolitical tensions have added a risk premium in China. Japan is one of the few international markets where policy interest rates remain low and therefore the spread between the risk-free rate and real estate yields remains stable. All regions globally are heading in the same direction: towards more energy-efficient, circular and sustainable buildings together with increased reporting and disclosure requirements.

Note: Bold type indicates the 20 highest-rated markets in Emerging Trends in Real Estate 2023 survey for overall real estate prospects. 73 Changes in Attitudes, Changes in Latitudes Befitting the changes in economic and market trends and outlooks that we have highlighted in this report, respondents to the Emerging Trends survey expressed substantial changes in market preferences. Many of the changes were relatively minor, and nine of the 10 highest-rated markets last year repeated this year . But there were some material changes over the year as about a quarter of markets moved up or down in rankings by at least 10 places. And consistent with our normal- izing trend, many of the markets near the top of the standings last year have fallen this year, while many previously lower- rate markets have risen: More than half (11) of the 20-highest rated markets in last years survey fell in the rankings this year, although almost all by less than 10 places. Meanwhile, some of the markets that were found lower in the rankings in prior years are now finding more support. Thirteen of the 20-lowest rated markets in last years survey rose in the rankings this year. Some Like It Hot Despite the modest drop in the Supernova ratings this year, Emerging Trends survey respondents still see the best prospects in Sun Belt metropolitan areas, which have been growing over time. The number of Sun Belt markets among the top 20 markets for overall prospects has increased from 10 in 2011 to 14 in each of the past two years. At the same time, the number of markets in cold-weather climates in the Northeast and Midwest has declined from five to just two . These climate preferences are even stronger at the top and bot- tom of the rankings.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!125: 3 2.6 2.4 3.3 2.7 3.0 2.9 1.6 2.2 2.7 2.4 2.3 2.9 2.4 2.0 1.9 2.2 2.0 1.8 2.0 2.3 2.1 2.1 2.1 1.5 1.8 2.1 previous two years, and only a scattering of others have placed over the past decade. Growth Attracts Its not heat and humidity that investors and developers seek in the Sun Belt markets, of course, but strong market prospects. And forecasts for population and especially economic growth show that are looking in the right places. Population and gross metro product (GMP) are both expected to grow far faster in the Magnet markets than just about anywhere else in the nation, particularly in the northern markets that constitute much of the Backbone markets. last four years to 1.6 percent over the next fivestill the highest of any subgroup but slower than before as these markets experi- ence some growing pains that we highlighted in our trends chapter. Also of note is that many of the Establishment markets that lost population during the pandemic are expected to reverse course and resume growth over the next few years. This growth will be slower than in our other market groups but represents the biggest increase from the recent past to the expected near term. This reversal perhaps accounts for the modest relative improve- ment in the 2023 ratings of the markets in this group. Accordingly, the Magnets have maintained their dominance at the top of the Emerging Trends ratings. Although their average ranking slipped slightly this year, more markets moved up than down. Growth is expected to be greatest in the Supernova subgroup but moderating from its recent torrid pace. For example, popula- tion growth is projected to slow from 1.9 percent annually over the Affordability Matters, Too Quality of life and affordability also matter.

S. 100.0. Total, United States 76 The More Things Change . . Real estate markets are ever dynamic and metropolitan econo- mies even more so. The relative rankings of the markets tracked in Emerging Trends changed meaningfully this year as eco- nomic conditions in the United States appear to be heading for a slide. Nonetheless, many Magnet markets remain among the most favored, even if some of them have slipped a bit this year. At the same time, real estate professionals appear more willing to consider some markets that had been less in favor in recent years. The perpetual search for new opportunities ensures con- stant flux in how markets are viewed over time. Grouping the Markets After comprehensively reorganizing how we group our 80 geo- graphic markets two years ago and a lighter refresh last year, we are continuing with the same groupings this year and turn our focus to how the various groups and some key markets have changed since our previous report. Additional demo- graphic and economic data and more detailed descriptions of these market groups are available online, as listed at the end of this chapter. Magnets Magnet markets are migration destinations for both people and companies, and most are growing more quickly than the U. S. average in terms of both population and jobs. These metro areas are also the preferred markets for investors and builders, with the highest average Overall Real Estate Prospects ratings of any group in the Emerging Trends survey by a wide margin. Collectively, these markets account for almost one-third of the population base in the Emerging Trends coverage universe, the second-largest group in Markets to Watch. Super Sun Belt. These markets are large and diverse but still affordable, forming powerhouse economies that attract a wide range of businesses. Despite their large population bases, most are among the fastest-growing markets in the United States. Moreover, their economic performance has been solid through thick and thin. Though every market lost jobs during the pan- demic recession, recovery has been much quicker and more complete in the Super Sun Belt markets. These metro areas collectively have the highest average rating of any subgroup, as it did last year. 18-Hour Cities.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, there were 14 Sun Belt markets in the top 20 overall prospects in 2011.\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

Just as Henry Ford slashed the time needed to build a Model T from 12 hours to 96 min- utes through process improvements, the same innovations and improvements should be focused on housing. If we could reduce cycle times in half to build a house, builders could offer homes for less, thus improving affordability across the board. Single-Family Rentals The rise of the single-family rental business has huge implica- tions for traditional builders. There are positive implicationsa hedge against slower demand from consumers of for-sale hous- ing, as many builders report that they are receiving multiple calls each day from single-family rental operators who want to con- tract builders to build homes. There are negative implications as well: as single-family rentals become more prevalent, they could become a competitor to traditional for-sale homes. The nascent stage of the industry makes the future hard to determine, but one ought to consider the following:  Nearly half of all master-planned communities are planning a build-for-rent section.  Thirty-five percent of single-family renters with budgets of $1,000-plus per month rent by choice.  Single-family renters with rent budgets of $1,000-plus per month prefer to rent for more flexibility, as well as for less maintenance and fewer financial responsibilities, than they would have as homeowners. 47 focused on supply chain optimization and less on absorb- ing additional space, other users are stepping up to secure additional space. E-commerce will continue to drive logistics demand for the foreseeable future with growing diversity. Demand Still Outpaces Inventory Given persistent stock-outs, rapidly rising prices, and unreli- able supply chains, the need for higher inventories increased. Inventory growth was rapid in the six months from February through July 2022, up 9 percent on a net basis for wholesale and retail. Although inventories are up, they continue to lag sales. The July 2022 inventory-to-sales ratio for all retailers was almost 4 percent below average 2019 levels. While inventories are growing, they are still too low overall.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2023_Housing_market_outlook__Price_dip_and_interes.pdf-!41:  Typically, four working days are needed for single-family homes and six for multi-family buildings. High political and social pressure on cities and municipalities to meet the district heating target is also likely to divert many resources to this area. The number of heat pumps is even expected to quadruple, from around 1.5 million at present to around 6 million by 2030. This is also particularly ambitious because the installation of a heat pump in a single-family house currently typically takes two weeks. According to the estimates made in the study, achieving the heat pump targets will require the working time of around 50,000 full-time equivalents. In 2022, there were about 190,000 employees subject to social insurance contributions working in the plumbing, heating, and air conditioning industry, according to the Labor Department's 2010 occupational classification. Almost all of them work full-time and 180,000 are skilled workers. The number of skilled workers in the heating sector alone cannot be determined from the occupational classification. Assuming 100,000 skilled workers in the heating sector, about half of the employees would have to install heat pumps in the future. To retrain every second employee on a new technology would undoubtedly be challenging. One argument against achieving the 6 million target is that not everyone can or wants to be retrained. Particularly among employees over 55 years of age, whose share according to occupational classification is around 19, willingness could be limited. Likewise, about one-sixth of the 180,000 skilled workers had no training at all. In this group, too, retraining could not be a foregone conclusion. In addition, the already high shortage of skilled workers must be taken into account. From 2012 to 2022, vacancy times for open positions in the plumbing, heating, and air-conditioning trades have risen from around 100 days to almost 240 days. The upcoming wave of retirements is expected to further exacerbate the situation. Likewise, there may be construction obstacles to heat pump installation. However, there are also a number of pro-arguments. For example, the learning curve for the new technology is likely to be steep. The number of workdays to install a heat pump could drop.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2023_Housing_market_outlook__Price_dip_and_interes.pdf-!42:  Likewise, manufacturers could improve heat pump efficiency. The high level of political will, the high and long-term growth in demand and the provision of billions in subsidies give manufacturers planning security and also make research and further development attractive. The annual coefficient of performance, which measures the ratio of thermal energy to electrical energy, could increase significantly. In practice, many heat pumps currently have an annual performance factor of around 3. In the future, modern heat pumps could have significantly higher values. Furthermore, the shortage of skilled workers and numerous countermeasures are discussed intensively in the study Building Strategy Climate Neutrality 2045. These range from education and training to increasing the quota of women, which is currently less than 1, to targeted immigration.

But it also remains questionable to what extent it will be possible to contain or even prevent climate damage through behavioural change, construction measures, precautions and good crisis management. The first indications are provided by the extensive data of the German Weather Service. Schleswig-Holstein, for example, tends to have low average summer temperatures, while BerlinBrandenburg tends to have high average temperatures. Historically, the difference between the two regions has averaged about 1.5C, and in recent years it has even been around 2C. Bavaria and Baden-Wrttemberg tend to have higher temperatures than Schleswig-Holstein, probably due to the higher number of sunshine hours. However, they typically also have higher precipitation, making fires and potential water rationing less likely. It also increases the yield of photovoltaic systems, which in turn could reduce utility costs. In general, it should also be true that low and high mountains tend to have higher soil moisture due to lower evapotranspiration. In contrast, BerlinBrandenburg is a rather dry region with a rather high risk of forest fires. Schleswig-Holstein, on the other hand, may be most affected by rising sea levels or the cost of higher dams. In view of the many influencing factors and the unclear regional effects of climate change, it will probably take several years before these are noticeably reflected in the return considerations of investors.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2023_Housing_market_outlook__Price_dip_and_interes.pdf-!48:  3 2 1 0 mm 500 400 300 200 100 0 mm 500 400 300 200 100 0 1 8 8 1 9 8 8 1 7 9 8 1 5 0 9 1 3 1 9 1 1 2 9 1 9 2 9 1 7 3 9 1 5 4 9 1 3 5 9 1 1 6 9 1 9 6 9 1 7 7 9 1 5 8 9 1 3 9 9 1 1 0 0 2 9 0 0 2 7 1 0 2 Range over Lnder BerlinBrandenburg minus Schleswig- Holstein Sources: Deutsche Bank Research, German Meteorological Service Precipitation in summer in Bavaria relative to other Lnder 40 1 8 8 1 9 8 8 1 7 9 8 1 5 0 9 1 3 1 9 1 1 2 9 1 9 2 9 1 7 3 9 1 5 4 9 1 3 5 9 1 1 ;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!48:  First, climate change may alter the dynamics of where we want to live. The hottest metro areas may soon face declining demandand potentially an exodus due to unbearable weather, even as households continue to migrate from colder climates to warmer metro areas overall. Large swathes of Texas and the U. S. Southwest have endured 100-degree highs almost every day this summer, with nighttime temperatures frequently not dipping below 80 degrees. And its not confined to just the Southwest. Heat domes have settled over the Pacific Northwest during the past two summers, bring- ing heatwaves unprecedented in their length and intensity. The built environment intensifies climate change as buildings and roads absorb and retain heat. This heat island effect raises not only daytime peaks but especially nighttime tempera- tures, which can be hazardous to humans if they cannot cool down at night. Sun Belt cities like Phoenix and Dallas are work- ing with CRE owners to reduce heat islands by expanding the tree canopy, adding reflective coatings or vegetation to roofs, and using cool pavements to reduce the heat absorption of asphalt streets and concrete sidewalks. These approaches are important and necessary but may ultimately prove inadequate to the challenge if climate change keeps ratcheting up tempera- tures as expected. Beyond the discomfort and health risks of living in ever-hotter climates, energy costs rise with temperatures, as do the risks of power outages as more strain is placed on power grids. A less obvious cost: higher temperatures and ultraviolet exposure can increase building maintenance costs. Extreme weather worsened by climate change is even exacerbating inflation as 24 Exhibit 1-16 Percentage of U. S.

Summary and outlook for Germany, metropolises and metropolitan regions 6.1 Competing price drivers and dampers The interest rate shock has ended the boom. The high price increases and equity yields are a thing of the past. Prices have been falling since spring 2022. How long this phase will last is analytically challenging. Many factors, some of which act in opposition to each other, have to be taken into account for a sound analysis. Significantly higher financing costs suggest even steeper price declines. In the case of unrefurbished and slightly refurbished buildings, the pricing-in of refurbishment costs also has a dampening effect on prices. This is all the more true as legislators are loudly considering tightening up replacement and refurbishment obligations. The main price driver is the fundamental supply shortage.;\n***\n[Submission]: The sky is blue because of the way sunlight interacts with the atmosphere.

But for now, the height- ened uncertainty is leading many players to stay on the sidelines as they wait to see where the market, particularly when it comes to pricing and valuations, settles. One interviewee noted their cautious approach when they said that they were sticking to the fairway, not trying to clear the trees and skip the dogleg, when it comes to deployment decisions. Cost Escalations amid Supply Chain Challenges and Labor Shortages On top of concerns about the capital markets are supply chain shortages and delays as well as significant increases in costs for labor and materials. Labor issues have been a challenge for some time, but rising costs and shortages of inputs including for key materials like steelhave added to the pressures. According to Statistics Canada, residential building costs were up 22.6 percent on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter of 2022. For nonresidential construction, cost increases were lower but still significant at 12.8 percent. Construction cost increases continued into the second quarter of 2022 amid inflationary pressures throughout the economy. Rising labor shortages are exacerbating the challenges. According to Statistics Canada, construction job vacancies reached a record high in the first quarter of 2022 and were double the number of open positions during the same period in 2020. And then there is the impact of construction wages, which were up 6.6 percent in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2021. All of this has made completing projects on time and on budget even harder than in the past, and the situation is unlikely to improve in the foreseeable future.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!27: 1 Changes to building codes over the past 10 years Sources: National Association of Home Builders. National Multifamily Housing Council. confidence suggests that that decline will likely continue until the interest rate environment turns more favorable. to a report from economists at the Fed, perhaps a reaction to lockdown claustrophobia. And the homes that do get built are expensive, particularly since the pandemic. Construction costs shot up due to supply chain disruptions and are still worrisome. As one housing industry adviser notes, Theres a stress index about global supply chains, and those stress indices are all indicating that theyre moderating, but theyre still at very high levels. Finally, high permitting fees and utility charges and large minimum lot sizes push developers to build more expensive homes. Renters Priced Out of the Homebuying Market With a growing share of households priced out of the for-sale market, demand for rental units is far outstripping new supply. Though population growth slowed sharply during the pandemic, demand is also rising from the many young adults eager to start their own households after moving back in with their parents during COVID. Further boosting demand is the increasing number of younger adults choosing to live alone, according The multifamily sector has responded with an unprecedented increase in new supply. Weve built more multifamily housing units over the last 10 years than we had in any other time since 1980, notes an adviser to institutional investors. But it is still far less than needed. Vacancies have fallen to their lowest levels ever while rents are rising faster than evereven faster than home prices. And though not a formal part of the affordability calculations, other housing-related costs like utilities and main- tenance are also rising faster than incomes, further constraining the ability of households to afford basic shelter. Moving to More Affordable Recent slowdowns in rent growth and home price appreciation, noted in our Normalizing trend, have done little to increase affordability. So how to address this? Millions of people have taken matters into their own hands.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!46:  In addition, new building could ease off further as construction projects are delayed as they are on the housing front because of a shortage of building materials. New construction projects are also being shelved be- cause of higher financing costs and a sharp rise in the price of materials.

Higher-barrier locations, on the other hand, may sustain higher rent growth for longer. Construction Is Battling Supply Chain Issues Real estate developers across the United States are confronting rising construction costs. Steel, concrete, and roofing materials contribute up to 80 percent of typical shell costs. Market price surges since the end of 2019 for these, and other major catego- ries, caused finished construction costs to spike by 50 percent. Construction durations in the broader industry have increased by two to three months, on average, since 2019, due to lon- ger material lead times and increasing contractor backlogs, according to a construction director at a large industrial owner. Advanced material procurement strategies and construction technology can resolve some ongoing construction issues. Developers are moving upstream in the value chain by lever- aging direct partnerships with national material suppliers to pre-secure and prioritize long-lead building materials and mitigate material shortages where possible. Developers are also introducing modularized construction systems to expedite repeatable project elements, such as office tenant improve- ments and in-warehouse restrooms, which reduce on-site construction timelines.

Though growing less affordable over time, these medium-sized cities nonetheless continue to attract in-migration due to lifestyle, workforce quality, and development opportuni- ties, according to ULI interviews. Measured by per capita GMP, workers here are the most productive of any subgroup in the fast-growing Magnets category. As a group, the 18-Hour Cities rate third highest among the 12 subgroups, though the average market ranking fell this year as four of the markets declined while three rose. Supernovas. Like the astronomic source for its name, the five metro areas in the Supernova category markets have exploded into prominence over the past decade or so. All are smaller markets with 1 million to 2 million residents, but their defining attribute is their tremendous and sustained population and job growth, which are well above national averages. Despite their relatively modest sizes, all the Supernovas have above-average levels of economic diversity and white-collar employment, which explain their strong investor appeal and should help them sus- tain high growth in the years ahead.

Nonetheless, the glow for this category has faded somewhat as their unfettered growth has invited some big-city problems like congestion and rising living costs. Last years shooting star, Boise, fell sharply after two years in the top 20. Raleigh has continued its modest decline, from the top-rated market in 2021 to number six in the 2023 survey. But more broadly, the Supernovas appear to be suffering some growing pains, as discussed elsewhere in this report. Housing construction is not keeping pace with household growth, strain- ing housing affordability, which has been one of the chief attractions. The Establishment The Establishment markets have long been the nations eco- nomic engines. The 20 markets in this category produce almost 43 percent of the GMP in the 80 Emerging Trends markets while accounting for only 34 percent of its population base. This pri- marily reflects the outsized contributions of the nations gateway markets, which we refer to as the Knowledge and Innovation Centers. Though growing more slowly than the Magnet markets, the Establishment markets still offer tremendous opportunities. This groups average rating is second among our four major group- ings. However, the appeal of these markets to investors and developers has waned in recent years as growth has slowed across many of these markets while challenges have increased. Multitalented Producers. Though all the Establishment markets are large and economically varied, some are more diverse than others, specifically the multitalented metro areas of Chicago, Los Angeles, San Jose, and Seattle.

Also of note is that many of the Establishment markets that lost population during the pandemic are expected to reverse course and resume growth over the next few years. This growth will be slower than in our other market groups but represents the biggest increase from the recent past to the expected near term. This reversal perhaps accounts for the modest relative improve- ment in the 2023 ratings of the markets in this group. Accordingly, the Magnets have maintained their dominance at the top of the Emerging Trends ratings. Although their average ranking slipped slightly this year, more markets moved up than down. Growth is expected to be greatest in the Supernova subgroup but moderating from its recent torrid pace. For example, popula- tion growth is projected to slow from 1.9 percent annually over the Affordability Matters, Too Quality of life and affordability also matter. Many of the markets that received relatively lower scores this year have inadequate infrastructure for their population size and growth, here measured by their transit availability score.;\n***\n[Submission]: The average size of a metro area in the Supernova category is 1 million to 2 million residents .\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

The cluster formation helps to mitigate the risks associated with real estate develop- ments, because it is easier to find a new tenant for a property. The reuse of a proper- ty is potentially more difficult outside the Life Science clusters. Requirements for property, labs and space vary. Start-ups need only a few hundred square metres of space, consisting essentially of labs for research and development. More space is generally required for further growth and the necessary clinical testing phases, with an increasing proportion of office usage. Given favourable economic prospects and associated expansion, management functions will become more im- portant, and demand for office space in particular will increase. Lab requirements also differ. Analysis by JLL differentiates between wet and dry labs, and biological and chemical wet labs. The requirements for a dry lab are fairly moderate, for example similar to utility rooms. The costs are therefore only slightly higher than for office space. The requirements for wet labs are considerably higher because they involve the use of chemicals and special analytical equipment. These include, for example, higher ceilings, special surfaces, and powerful extraction and ventilation systems for gases and liquids. The costs of construction, interior fittings and ongoing operations can be significantly higher than for classic office space here.

These include the following: 16  High ceilings and floor-to-ceiling window lines that allow for abundant natural light.  Sustainable design that minimizes or even zeros out the buildings carbon footprint. And  Premium health and safety features, such as efficient HVAC systems with rapid air-refresh rates. The U. S. head of real estate banking for another major invest- ment firm sees office building quality more as a competitive advantage in the war for talent. Major companies, especially their headquarters space, think of that as synonymous with their brand. And so if they want to attract talent, they want to be at a modern, sustainable building. Those rents continue to hold up really well, says the head of a real estate investment bank. And everything else continues to be really, really tough. So its going to be trophy and trauma in the business. It is almost hard to overstate how much that older office product has fallen out of favor. A global portfolio man- ager of an investment management firm explains that office, especially value-add office, has kind of become toxic. The debt funds were the primary lender to value-add, especially opportu- nistic office. Thats completely dried up. As with failing retail centers, many of these older office assets will need to be either upgraded or converted, as discussed in our next trend on repurposing obsolete buildings. The biggest challenge is the enormous cost of renovating a 40-year-old building to the health and safety and sustainability features and modern design standards offered by the top-tier properties. Mainstreaming of Niche Property Types In last years Emerging Trends, we documented the growing interest by institutional investors in nontraditional CRE product types. This years survey and interviews reveal an even stronger interest in niche products. Niche property types occupy five of the top-rated six slots for investment prospects, as shown in chapter 2, including the two top subsectors, workforce housing and data centers. This shift partly reflects investor expectations that cyclical trends will reduce returns in 2022 and 2023, intensifying the eternal search for yield.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!21:  As a result, we expect that the best office buildingsin terms of both location and building specificationswill perform more strongly than others. Not all regions will move at the same pace in this arena, with Europe leading the way. Looking beyond basic sector labels also reveals potential sources of strength. Investors should keep in mind that umbrella groupings like office, retail, industrial, residential and nichealternative are far from monolithic and are subject to unique market conditions that vary by location and property subtype. For example, research lab space, medical office buildings and more traditional office space should not be grouped under the same crude umbrella term of office space. The supply and demand fundamentals affecting each of these have become highly polarized, especially in the US. We are much more confident in the prospects of grocery-anchored retail in the US and Asia Pacific, or outlet malls in the UK, than we are of the broader retail markets in these geographies. 1 JLLLaSalle Global Real Estate Transparency Index (GRETI), July 2022 ISA Outlook 2023 18 ISA Outlook 2023 19 G LO BA L A S I A PAC I F I C E U R O P E N O R T H A M E R I CA G.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!8: 4 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021 2023e 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021 2023e LIFE SCIENCES: FOCUS ON HEALTH Research offices are a niche segment, but also a growth market Staying healthy as you age  who wouldnt want that? In simplified terms, this is the motivation driving the booming Life Sciences sector of the economy, which is resear- ching corresponding solutions. However, classic office premises are not appropriate for companies in this segment. Although office space is required for administrative and management functions, the main focus is on laboratory space used by the biolo- gists, chemists and medical staff who are carrying out the research. This combinati- on - the young lab offices segment - is of increasing interest to investors. What lies behind the lab office trend and what potential does it have? The Covid pandemic is a starting point for a review of this segment. It has not only shifted vaccine development into the public focus, but has also brought into the mainstream concepts such as vulnerable and pre-existing conditions to refer to people at risk of serious cases of Covid 19. Because people are living longer thanks to medical progress, these concepts apply to large sections of the population and not just to a small number of people. In 2021 in Germany more than one fifth of the po- pulation  around 18 million people  had reached the age of 65. However, increa- sed life expectancy has not so far been accompanied by improved fitness levels. In fact the opposite is true. A sedentary lifestyle, high-calorie food, ready meals contai- ning a lot of sugar, and the consumption of alcohol and tobacco have consequences, and considerably increase the risk of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, demen- tia, heart attacks, cancer and strokes. The growing number of older people suffering ill health is also a significant economic factor.;\n***\n[Submission]: Answer: Yes, the structure of an atom consists of a nucleus containing protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons in shells or orbitals .\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

And one out of every four households spends 50 percent or more of their wages on housing. Those percentages reflect divides that deepen because not enough new apartment units are coming online. A present that is polarized grows more so over time. For market- rate property investors, developers, owners, and managers, what lies ahead is the brightest beacon of prosperity. But for those who live and reside below the cutline of wherewithal and social mobility, the future of apartment rentals holds more ques- tions than answers. With 1.3 million new U. S. households projected each year through 2035, apartment industry trade groupsthe National Multifamily Housing Council (NMHC) and the National Apartment Associationcalculate that the United States needs 4.3 million newly built apartments between now and then. That level of new development would work out to 331,000 new multifamily rental units annually. This would expand the exist- ing apartment rental stock in the United States by more than 20 percent in just over a decade. What makes this goal plausible are two strong tailwinds: household demographics and an unprecedented global embrace of apartment development by the investment community. Still, the throes of land use policy drag on development. But beyond local policy barriers, tugging housing to its future, are a trio of macro forcesworklife balance, an urgency to stall the climate effects of global warming, and an array of technolo- giesin business management, livability, and construction. Can this darling of real estate asset classes sustain its hold on global investment inflows, unleash constructions modern manu- facturing era, turn the tide on local political will, and win over the hearts, minds, and pocketbooks of consumer households to pull off such a feat? If you had to guess todaywith residential rental vacancies at historical lows of 6.2 percent and occupancy rates and median asking rents for vacant units at historical highsthe answer would be a cautious yes.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!68:   Two, demand gathered speed and sweep as people sought larger living spaces to balance remote work and household life, and more outdoor living options.  Three, constrained construction of new supply, and a price run-up on the single-family for-sale front, spilled over into expanded apartment demand.  Lastly, compounding the effects of these four dramatic imbalances came the rocket fuel of a global capital rotation toward de-risked assets . Outsized demand, a sudden spike in remote work mobility, constricted supply, and floods of money with nowhere better to goa grand slam of anomalies. The U. S. apartment property sectorproviding shelter to 37 mil- lion residents in 21.3 million structures of five or more household units, and contributing $3.4 trillion annually to the U. S. economy, according to the NMHCmorphed quickly into an investment asset class pressure cooker. Inflated property valuations, com- pressed cap rates, and a sea change from individual owners to medium and large-sized corporate owners became a new norm seemingly overnight. This time period veers wildly from a steady slope of otherwise well-entrenched trends across the structural demand front. Operational modernization kicked into super-fast-forward mode toward self-service, and a robust new-development pipeline at least. According to a recent Bloomberg report, After dipping in 2020, the number of new units authorized in multifamily build- ings took off, running 37 percent higher over the past 12 months as of June 2022 than in the same period in 20182019. As of August, 862,000 apartments were under construction, up 25 percent from a year ago. At the same time, COVIDs aftermath sharply defined conflicting forceswhich together destine virtually all of Americas newly developed and built apartment communities for a financially privileged professional class. Rather than causing an expansion of rental housing stock, however, higher-income households come-lately demand for rental neighborhoods instead served to crowd out moderate- and lower-income households in supply- constrained areas. Its been virtually impossible to build affordable, says the chief executive of one of the apartment industry trade groups.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!71:  Class A property investments align with rent-by-choice higher- income households and a swelling population of aging Americans ready to downsize and simplify. B and C value-add investments suit a growing market of younger and mid-career households stuck in the limbo of scarce supply, high prices, and high interest mortgages that will delay their becoming homeowners. Closing a gaping, and widening, chasm in new investment and development would well serve households in the 80 to 120 percent range of area median household income levels the wage range of many essential workers such as teachers, sanitation workers, law enforcement officers, and fire and medical first responders. Furthermore, addressing this missing middle household income level does not preclude the need for additions to and preservation of properties for lower-income households. The Great Bottleneck: Local Ballot Boxes Apartment stakeholders number-one nemesis, blocking private- sector market solutions to deep and growing mismatches between demand and supply, is a many-headed hydraa bevy of deep-rooted restrictive land use, permitting, and regulatory cost burdens that thwart higher-density multifamily develop- ment. On top of these longstanding challenges, a growing push for rent regulation is adding uncertainty to the market. For example, while 26 states prohibit local municipalities from implementing rent control laws, five states permit localities to enforce rent controlNew York, New Jersey, California, Oregon, and Marylandas well as Washington, D.

S. and Canada are relatively well-placed in an international context. The southern sunbelt states are set to outperform due to migration patterns, a tax-friendly environment, expanding workforce and greater affordability. Various niche sectors are more mature and point to the way forward for the development of real estate markets elsewhere in the world. North America Macro-economic trends The direct impact of the Russian war in Ukraine on the U. S. has been limited as the country is virtually energy independent, but soaring inflation, higher interest rates and weaker consumer and producer confidence will nevertheless lead to slower economic growth. Rapid monetary policy tightening will likely push the whole of North America into a downturn during the final quarter of 2022 with recovery expected in late 2023. The U. S. and Canada are, however, well-placed compared to many other international markets, and continue to be viewed as a safe haven.

And the homes that do get built are expensive, particularly since the pandemic. Construction costs shot up due to supply chain disruptions and are still worrisome. As one housing industry adviser notes, Theres a stress index about global supply chains, and those stress indices are all indicating that theyre moderating, but theyre still at very high levels. Finally, high permitting fees and utility charges and large minimum lot sizes push developers to build more expensive homes. Renters Priced Out of the Homebuying Market With a growing share of households priced out of the for-sale market, demand for rental units is far outstripping new supply. Though population growth slowed sharply during the pandemic, demand is also rising from the many young adults eager to start their own households after moving back in with their parents during COVID. Further boosting demand is the increasing number of younger adults choosing to live alone, according The multifamily sector has responded with an unprecedented increase in new supply. Weve built more multifamily housing units over the last 10 years than we had in any other time since 1980, notes an adviser to institutional investors. But it is still far less than needed. Vacancies have fallen to their lowest levels ever while rents are rising faster than evereven faster than home prices. And though not a formal part of the affordability calculations, other housing-related costs like utilities and main- tenance are also rising faster than incomes, further constraining the ability of households to afford basic shelter. Moving to More Affordable Recent slowdowns in rent growth and home price appreciation, noted in our Normalizing trend, have done little to increase affordability. So how to address this? Millions of people have taken matters into their own hands.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!68:   Two, demand gathered speed and sweep as people sought larger living spaces to balance remote work and household life, and more outdoor living options.  Three, constrained construction of new supply, and a price run-up on the single-family for-sale front, spilled over into expanded apartment demand.  Lastly, compounding the effects of these four dramatic imbalances came the rocket fuel of a global capital rotation toward de-risked assets . Outsized demand, a sudden spike in remote work mobility, constricted supply, and floods of money with nowhere better to goa grand slam of anomalies. The U. S. apartment property sectorproviding shelter to 37 mil- lion residents in 21.3 million structures of five or more household units, and contributing $3.4 trillion annually to the U. S. economy, according to the NMHCmorphed quickly into an investment asset class pressure cooker. Inflated property valuations, com- pressed cap rates, and a sea change from individual owners to medium and large-sized corporate owners became a new norm seemingly overnight. This time period veers wildly from a steady slope of otherwise well-entrenched trends across the structural demand front. Operational modernization kicked into super-fast-forward mode toward self-service, and a robust new-development pipeline at least. According to a recent Bloomberg report, After dipping in 2020, the number of new units authorized in multifamily build- ings took off, running 37 percent higher over the past 12 months as of June 2022 than in the same period in 20182019. As of August, 862,000 apartments were under construction, up 25 percent from a year ago. At the same time, COVIDs aftermath sharply defined conflicting forceswhich together destine virtually all of Americas newly developed and built apartment communities for a financially privileged professional class. Rather than causing an expansion of rental housing stock, however, higher-income households come-lately demand for rental neighborhoods instead served to crowd out moderate- and lower-income households in supply- constrained areas.

The growth of the sector into new product types differenti- ated by rate and service offerings as the sector continues to mature and evolve. 2. The articulation of a new value proposition for senior hous- ing as the proverbial fountain of youth for future baby boomer residents who seek a high quality of life, wellness, longevity, and a sense of purpose. 3. The recognition that senior housing is truly part of the health care continuum. 4. The gradual recovery of occupancy from the nadir reached during COVID-19, boosted by a recent slowdown in inven- tory growth and strong post-pandemic demand patterns. 5. Outside exogenous factors including the national and global economies, inflation, and rising interest rates, which present new challenges for senior housing. 6.;\n***\n[Submission]: No, the number of new units authorized in multifamily buildings and the number of single-family housing starts did not trend in the same direction in 2022.

Australia is cementing its status as a safe haven in the region. Singapores relative attractiveness to Hong Kong is expec- ted to increase. Higher interest rates are less of a concern in Japan where the spread between the risk-free rate and real estate yields remains stable. A zero-Covid-19 policy, a troubled property sector and geopolitical tensions have led to a risk premium for China. Asia Pacific Macro-economic trends The Asia-Pacific region is expected to grow faster during 2023- 2025 compared with the U. S. or EU with a lower risk of recession. Within the region, and for the first time in decades, it is expected that Australia and Singapore will record higher quarterly GDP growth figures in Q3 and Q4 2022 than China. During the outlook period, China is expected to recover and follow its growth path but at a slower pace .

The one-year prime loan rate is currently 3.65. Rising inflation and higher interest rates are a concern for all Asia-Pacific markets, with the exception of China and Japan. Japan is keeping a lid on interest rate growth and its benchmark 10-year government bond rate remains close to zero. The spread between property yields and the risk-free rate is therefore intact. However, the Bank of Japans persistently low interest rate policy means that the exchange rate of the yen against the USD is now at a 50-year low.;\n\nreal_estate_index:bouwinvest_international-market-outlook_2023-2025-1.pdf-!14:  As China works through its real estate market challenges, for example its over-leveraged property developers, we believe the market will be subject to a real estate risk premium due to the abovementioned geopolitical issues. The value of real estate properties in Japan is expected to remain fairly stable over the outlook period and yields may even compress slightly. Property prices in Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea are expected to fall in H2 2022 and 2023 as the risk-free rate rises and yields continue to correct. Australia looks attractive over the longer term, i. e. after 2023, as property performance forecasts are stable and positive, cementing its position as a safe haven in the region. Bouwinvest Outlook 2023-2025 24 Asia Pacific Residential Many of the fundamental demand drivers for residential real estate in Europe and the U. S. are visible in the Asia-Pacific region as well, but Asia Pacific stands out due to the long- term trend of its growing middle class. By 2030, the region will account for 66 of the global middle-class population compared with 30 in 2009. This increase will accelerate the existing trend of urbanization, which means that population and economic growth will be higher in large cities, including the surrounding metropolitan areas, compared with national averages. This could lead to interesting residential real estate opportunities. In some markets such as Australia, Hong Kong and China, sales volumes and prices are falling in the owner-occupier residential market due to rising mortgage rates. Development land values are expected to decline as a result. Market conditions in cities like Singapore and Sydney remain very tight, with demand expected to exceed supply, even without factoring in greater immigration flows in both countries, more international students and shifts in inter-state migration patterns in the case of Australia. Build to rent (BTR) strategies in Australia are gaining traction, and supply is set to grow rapidly in relative terms over the outlook period. In absolute terms, however, BTR is still very rare and forms a very limited part of the overall stock. The accessibility and affordability of some cities are cause for growing concern.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!34:  Economic growth in China in 2023 should be below historical averages, but strong enough to make it one of the fastest growing large economies. In Japan, yield curve control comes at the cost of a weak yen. If the Bank of Japan (BoJ) remains committed to keeping interest rates near zero, currency intervention, such as yen-buying to prevent further depreciation, could be on the table again. However, currency intervention has rarely been successful absent the cooperation from other central banks. Any changes to the yield control approach are likely to come after BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kurodas term concludes in April 2023. Nonetheless, most of the challenges Japan is facing are externally driven, while domestic-driven fundamentals remain relatively healthy. Australia, South Korea and Singapore are the most directly impacted by rising interest rates in the West. The outlook of these economies is likely to follow AP.1 Diverging monetary policies in Asia Pacific the trends in the West, albeit to varying degrees. The Monetary Authority of Singapore manages monetary policies through the foreign exchange markets, given that for a small and open economy, the exchange rate has a much stronger influence on inflation than the interest rate. That said, the magnitude of interest rate hikes in Singapore has been less than that of the US. Additionally, an increasing number of firms are pivoting to Singapore for their regional headquarters due to its geopolitical stability. All of these are adding to the relative strength of Singapores economy. The weakness of Asia Pacific currencies is mostly a story of US dollar strength. Nevertheless, uncertainties over the macro outlook and the dispersion among regional economies could lead to the continuing divergence of real estate market performance in the next 12-24 months. The diverse economic and real estate market trends within the region have the potential to contribute diversification benefits to institutional investors global portfolios.

Frankfurt is a strong retail location with its two prime locations Zeil and Goethestrae as well as several large shopping centres. Another plus point is the fairly moderate decline in prime rents given the negative conditions. By the end of 2021 they had fallen by around 8 per cent to EUR 275 per m2 and have since remained unchanged. Plans for the City of Frankfurt to play an active role in the development of the city centre - some of which is not very attractive - are also positive. A total of EUR 30m is to be invested in city centre projects, with the aim of upgrading the quality of stay. How- ever, retail is also playing a role here. For example, the Galeria store at the entrance to the Zeil has been remodelled into the Weltstadthaus and has been visibly upgraded while remaining open. The former sports arena building which is also close to the Hauptwache is being demolished and will be replaced by 2024 by a modern commercial building with offices.

Now however, both Berlin and Munich have broken past that barrier. Even so, Frankfurt remains the most expensive German of- fice market with a figure of EUR 44 per m2 since the prime rent has also risen further in the banking capital. In contrast to Berlin and Munich, however, take-up in the first half of 2022 was more muted at just over 150,000 m2.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!30: 9 Berlin Dussel- dorf Frank- furt Ham- burg Cologne Munich Stutt- gart purchasing power federal average Ham- burg Berlin Cologne Frank- Munich Dussel- average dorf Stutt- gart furt 12.9 13.3 Source: Comfort Source: bulwiengesa Summary: Retail market City centre retail is struggling against massive headwinds, which will not be easily overcome. Space rental should therefore become more difficult again towards year- end, and rents could fall again both this year and next year. Retailers looking for space should therefore retain their strong negotiating position. However, some positive factors are also likely to persist beyond the current crisis conditions. E-commerce benefited from the pandemic. However, despite all the en- thusiasm for online shopping, people still enjoy going on a shopping trip  and ma- king purchases  in the city centre. The boost which the pandemic provided for E- commerce could be less sustained than anticipated. This is borne out by the recent experience of online providers such as Amazon and Shopify, with the former plan- ning to sublet logistics space, and job shedding at the latter. Online shopping will undoubtedly continue to grow, but probably at a slightly slower pace. However, city centre retail also has further potential as the volume of pedestrians and tourists picks up again. It is up to retailers, property owners and cities to exploit this potential. Despite strong headwinds, city centre retail  ..;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!39:  By the end of 2021 prime rents were down by 12 per cent on 2019 to EUR 250 per m2, and have since been stagnating. To reduce the number of visible vacant properties, the Hamburg Senate has established a funding programme to enable creative businesses and start-ups to temporarily rent unused retail space. By the end of 2022 Karstadt Sport will accordingly become an Artstadt. In summer and autumn 2022, the former Kaufhof store is also being used for an exhibition by the street artist Banksy. However, the long-term use of the two department stores remains unde- cided. A new building with bars and restaurants, a hotel and offices and trade on the ground floor and first floor is also being constructed in Mnckebergstrae to replace the CA store. A shopping centre with sales space of around 80,000 m2 in the Ha- fenCity due for completion in 2024 could represent a headwind for the city centre with its sales space of around 350,000 m2.

Nonetheless, the glow for this category has faded somewhat as their unfettered growth has invited some big-city problems like congestion and rising living costs. Last years shooting star, Boise, fell sharply after two years in the top 20. Raleigh has continued its modest decline, from the top-rated market in 2021 to number six in the 2023 survey. But more broadly, the Supernovas appear to be suffering some growing pains, as discussed elsewhere in this report. Housing construction is not keeping pace with household growth, strain- ing housing affordability, which has been one of the chief attractions. The Establishment The Establishment markets have long been the nations eco- nomic engines. The 20 markets in this category produce almost 43 percent of the GMP in the 80 Emerging Trends markets while accounting for only 34 percent of its population base. This pri- marily reflects the outsized contributions of the nations gateway markets, which we refer to as the Knowledge and Innovation Centers. Though growing more slowly than the Magnet markets, the Establishment markets still offer tremendous opportunities. This groups average rating is second among our four major group- ings. However, the appeal of these markets to investors and developers has waned in recent years as growth has slowed across many of these markets while challenges have increased. Multitalented Producers. Though all the Establishment markets are large and economically varied, some are more diverse than others, specifically the multitalented metro areas of Chicago, Los Angeles, San Jose, and Seattle. Workers here tend to be productive, with per capita GMP ranking the second highest of any of the subgroups. Though their elevated cost of doing business and getting deals done limits their appeal for some real estate professionals, the Multitalented Producers Exhibit 3-8 U.

Many of the changes were relatively minor, and nine of the 10 highest-rated markets last year repeated this year . But there were some material changes over the year as about a quarter of markets moved up or down in rankings by at least 10 places. And consistent with our normal- izing trend, many of the markets near the top of the standings last year have fallen this year, while many previously lower- rate markets have risen: More than half (11) of the 20-highest rated markets in last years survey fell in the rankings this year, although almost all by less than 10 places. Meanwhile, some of the markets that were found lower in the rankings in prior years are now finding more support. Thirteen of the 20-lowest rated markets in last years survey rose in the rankings this year. Some Like It Hot Despite the modest drop in the Supernova ratings this year, Emerging Trends survey respondents still see the best prospects in Sun Belt metropolitan areas, which have been growing over time. The number of Sun Belt markets among the top 20 markets for overall prospects has increased from 10 in 2011 to 14 in each of the past two years. At the same time, the number of markets in cold-weather climates in the Northeast and Midwest has declined from five to just two . These climate preferences are even stronger at the top and bot- tom of the rankings.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!128:  average, where U. S. 100.0. Total, United States 76 The More Things Change . . Real estate markets are ever dynamic and metropolitan econo- mies even more so. The relative rankings of the markets tracked in Emerging Trends changed meaningfully this year as eco- nomic conditions in the United States appear to be heading for a slide. Nonetheless, many Magnet markets remain among the most favored, even if some of them have slipped a bit this year. At the same time, real estate professionals appear more willing to consider some markets that had been less in favor in recent years. The perpetual search for new opportunities ensures con- stant flux in how markets are viewed over time. Grouping the Markets After comprehensively reorganizing how we group our 80 geo- graphic markets two years ago and a lighter refresh last year, we are continuing with the same groupings this year and turn our focus to how the various groups and some key markets have changed since our previous report. Additional demo- graphic and economic data and more detailed descriptions of these market groups are available online, as listed at the end of this chapter. Magnets Magnet markets are migration destinations for both people and companies, and most are growing more quickly than the U. S. average in terms of both population and jobs. These metro areas are also the preferred markets for investors and builders, with the highest average Overall Real Estate Prospects ratings of any group in the Emerging Trends survey by a wide margin. Collectively, these markets account for almost one-third of the population base in the Emerging Trends coverage universe, the second-largest group in Markets to Watch. Super Sun Belt. These markets are large and diverse but still affordable, forming powerhouse economies that attract a wide range of businesses. Despite their large population bases, most are among the fastest-growing markets in the United States. Moreover, their economic performance has been solid through thick and thin. Though every market lost jobs during the pan- demic recession, recovery has been much quicker and more complete in the Super Sun Belt markets. These metro areas collectively have the highest average rating of any subgroup, as it did last year. 18-Hour Cities.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!132:  Only Boston remains among the 20 top-rated markets. Boston has leveraged its regions world- class concentration of higher education to become a world leader in life sciences. Major Market Adjacent. This group includes the markets sur- rounding high-cost CBDs in Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, San Francisco, and Washington, D. C. Though most are subur- ban in character, some are more urban. Moreover, several are or contain metropolitan statistical areas in their own right. Many of these markets benefited from the out-migration from their neighboring CBDs during the pandemic, and their prospects have improved somewhat in the eyes of survey respondents. But here, too, there is a diversity in trends as seven of the 12 markets improved this year and five declined. Most of the improvement was registered in the New York metropolitan area, while the declining markets are mainly in California. Exhibit 3-9 U. S.

We would side with the second argument. First, risk should define the yield. This means that assets with a higher risk profile will need to adjust to an even higher yield to maintain a risk premium over more core assets. And second, in a period of high inflation, the value of the income of an asset will erode unless it can generate rental growth. Higher yielding assets generally come from sectors with weak occupational demand, hence the risk of void periods and negative rental growth are much higher, particularly during a period of economic stress. Sectors including life sciences, student accommodation, cold storage logistics and self- storage where there are strong structural drivers to support rental growth, are expected to see the greatest value protection. This was welcome news for markets. While unlikely to change the JPY direction, we take comfort that both the government and the BoJ are on the same page. First, this helps to buy time until the US Fed softens its hawkish stance. Second, there is also a positive implication that the next BoJ governor due to be appointed in April 2023 will not deviate materially. To be clear, an exit from the ultra-loose policy is possible in the medium-term. However, it will most likely be done in a gradual manner. For 2023, at least, the current policy should stay and the chances are even higher now that the peak of global inflation and interest rates are drawing close. Will Japan remain an outlier market with low interest rates? With VC funding slowing, what is the outlook for life sciences real estate? Based on data from Pitchbook,global venture capital invested into life sciences companies in 2022 is set to fall by around 25 on the volume recorded in 2021.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!44:   Tightening financial conditions, especially in South Korea and Australia, could create opportunities for higher return strategies.

In Japan, yield curve control comes at the cost of a weak yen. If the Bank of Japan (BoJ) remains committed to keeping interest rates near zero, currency intervention, such as yen-buying to prevent further depreciation, could be on the table again. However, currency intervention has rarely been successful absent the cooperation from other central banks. Any changes to the yield control approach are likely to come after BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kurodas term concludes in April 2023. Nonetheless, most of the challenges Japan is facing are externally driven, while domestic-driven fundamentals remain relatively healthy. Australia, South Korea and Singapore are the most directly impacted by rising interest rates in the West. The outlook of these economies is likely to follow AP.1 Diverging monetary policies in Asia Pacific the trends in the West, albeit to varying degrees. The Monetary Authority of Singapore manages monetary policies through the foreign exchange markets, given that for a small and open economy, the exchange rate has a much stronger influence on inflation than the interest rate. That said, the magnitude of interest rate hikes in Singapore has been less than that of the US. Additionally, an increasing number of firms are pivoting to Singapore for their regional headquarters due to its geopolitical stability. All of these are adding to the relative strength of Singapores economy. The weakness of Asia Pacific currencies is mostly a story of US dollar strength. Nevertheless, uncertainties over the macro outlook and the dispersion among regional economies could lead to the continuing divergence of real estate market performance in the next 12-24 months. The diverse economic and real estate market trends within the region have the potential to contribute diversification benefits to institutional investors global portfolios. Three-month interest rates A S I A PAC I F I C Diverse, domestically- driven capital markets Commercial real estate transaction activities in Asia Pacific during the first nine months of 2022 came off 2021s record highs , primarily driven by rising interest rates in South Korea, Australia and Hong Kong, as well as COVID-19 lockdowns in China.;\n\nreal_estate_index:global-real-estate-markets-2023.pdf-!2:  Overall, we think that global capital values will bottom out in the second half of 2023, with the timing dependent upon how the economy fairs and a longer adjustment possible. 1 According to MSCI Global Quarterly Property Index and FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Index in USD. For example, owners who are forced to sell assets because they are unable to refinance debt or need to sell for other reasons, such as generating liquidity quickly. In such situations, sellers may be willing to accept below-market prices, or indeed have to, in order to facilitate a sale. For investors wanting to deploy capital now, holding off for a few months as pricing adjusts is probably the best strategy. Given the higher interest rate environment, we also think that floating rate real estate debt is an attractive way to achieve strong inflation protected returns and generate a good income return from real estate. Finally, looking across the globe, another potential opportunity for investors in 2023 is Japan, due to accretive hedging gains for investment into this market. Indeed, investors need to be mindful of large differences in monetary policy as interest rate differentials between countries determine the cost of hedging. Currently, Japan is particularly attractive on an after-hedging basis, since interest rates there are lower than in other markets. Page 3 of 8 What opportunities exist for investors in 2023? Which markets and sectors are the most defensive? There are two schools of thought in answering this question. One would argue that higher yielding assets offer greater value protection as they have a wider spread to the rising bond yields, and in some cases leverage can still be accretive. Yes, we think so. Japans economic recovery has lagged. The labor market improved in 2022, but is still soft relative to 2019. October inflation at 3.6 was the highest in four decades, but modest versus other countries. The pressure was also largely imported while domestic inflation stayed benign. In that context, maintaining the loose monetary policy appears the right thing to do. However, something has to give due to this diverging policy stance versus elsewhere.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, the Bank of Japan is committed to keeping interest rates near zero which can make Japan an attractive diversifier for institutional investors .\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

Australia is cementing its status as a safe haven in the region. Singapores relative attractiveness to Hong Kong is expec- ted to increase. Higher interest rates are less of a concern in Japan where the spread between the risk-free rate and real estate yields remains stable. A zero-Covid-19 policy, a troubled property sector and geopolitical tensions have led to a risk premium for China. Asia Pacific Macro-economic trends The Asia-Pacific region is expected to grow faster during 2023- 2025 compared with the U. S. or EU with a lower risk of recession. Within the region, and for the first time in decades, it is expected that Australia and Singapore will record higher quarterly GDP growth figures in Q3 and Q4 2022 than China. During the outlook period, China is expected to recover and follow its growth path but at a slower pace . Bouwinvest Outlook 2023-2025 21 Asia Pacific GDP Growth Asia Pacific Source: Oxford Economics, baseline scenario 2022 Q4 2023 Q4 2024 Q4 2025 Q4 Australia China Japan Singapore Hong Kong China usually props up its economy with direct measures such as infrastructure spending or fiscal support rather than adjustments to its interest rates. The one-year prime loan rate is currently 3.65. Rising inflation and higher interest rates are a concern for all Asia-Pacific markets, with the exception of China and Japan. Japan is keeping a lid on interest rate growth and its benchmark 10-year government bond rate remains close to zero. The spread between property yields and the risk-free rate is therefore intact. However, the Bank of Japans persistently low interest rate policy means that the exchange rate of the yen against the USD is now at a 50-year low.;\n\nreal_estate_index:bouwinvest_international-market-outlook_2023-2025-1.pdf-!14:  As China works through its real estate market challenges, for example its over-leveraged property developers, we believe the market will be subject to a real estate risk premium due to the abovementioned geopolitical issues. The value of real estate properties in Japan is expected to remain fairly stable over the outlook period and yields may even compress slightly. Property prices in Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea are expected to fall in H2 2022 and 2023 as the risk-free rate rises and yields continue to correct. Australia looks attractive over the longer term, i. e. after 2023, as property performance forecasts are stable and positive, cementing its position as a safe haven in the region. Bouwinvest Outlook 2023-2025 24 Asia Pacific Residential Many of the fundamental demand drivers for residential real estate in Europe and the U. S. are visible in the Asia-Pacific region as well, but Asia Pacific stands out due to the long- term trend of its growing middle class. By 2030, the region will account for 66 of the global middle-class population compared with 30 in 2009. This increase will accelerate the existing trend of urbanization, which means that population and economic growth will be higher in large cities, including the surrounding metropolitan areas, compared with national averages. This could lead to interesting residential real estate opportunities. In some markets such as Australia, Hong Kong and China, sales volumes and prices are falling in the owner-occupier residential market due to rising mortgage rates. Development land values are expected to decline as a result. Market conditions in cities like Singapore and Sydney remain very tight, with demand expected to exceed supply, even without factoring in greater immigration flows in both countries, more international students and shifts in inter-state migration patterns in the case of Australia. Build to rent (BTR) strategies in Australia are gaining traction, and supply is set to grow rapidly in relative terms over the outlook period. In absolute terms, however, BTR is still very rare and forms a very limited part of the overall stock. The accessibility and affordability of some cities are cause for growing concern.;\n\nreal_estate_index:isa-outlook-2023.pdf-!38:  The probability that this cycle will end with a systemic dislocation like the Global Financial Crisis is still low, despite the short-term volatility. If the global environment of high inflation and interest rates lasts longer than anticipated, there could be meaningful price corrections in the region. rates than REITs in other listed markets in the region due to their relatively high exposure to floating rate debt. Financial conditions in Singapore are expected to fare slightly better than those of South Korea and Australia, as Singapore benefits from strong investor appetite due to its relative economic strength and geopolitical stability. Although uncertainties remain, monetary easing, the rise of RMB funds, the rapid development of domestic REITs in China and the gradual relaxation of COVID restrictions in Hong Kong could offset some downside risks in these two capital markets.

Many of the changes were relatively minor, and nine of the 10 highest-rated markets last year repeated this year . But there were some material changes over the year as about a quarter of markets moved up or down in rankings by at least 10 places. And consistent with our normal- izing trend, many of the markets near the top of the standings last year have fallen this year, while many previously lower- rate markets have risen: More than half (11) of the 20-highest rated markets in last years survey fell in the rankings this year, although almost all by less than 10 places. Meanwhile, some of the markets that were found lower in the rankings in prior years are now finding more support. Thirteen of the 20-lowest rated markets in last years survey rose in the rankings this year. Some Like It Hot Despite the modest drop in the Supernova ratings this year, Emerging Trends survey respondents still see the best prospects in Sun Belt metropolitan areas, which have been growing over time. The number of Sun Belt markets among the top 20 markets for overall prospects has increased from 10 in 2011 to 14 in each of the past two years. At the same time, the number of markets in cold-weather climates in the Northeast and Midwest has declined from five to just two . These climate preferences are even stronger at the top and bot- tom of the rankings.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!128:  average, where U. S. 100.0.

The relative rankings of the markets tracked in Emerging Trends changed meaningfully this year as eco- nomic conditions in the United States appear to be heading for a slide. Nonetheless, many Magnet markets remain among the most favored, even if some of them have slipped a bit this year. At the same time, real estate professionals appear more willing to consider some markets that had been less in favor in recent years. The perpetual search for new opportunities ensures con- stant flux in how markets are viewed over time. Grouping the Markets After comprehensively reorganizing how we group our 80 geo- graphic markets two years ago and a lighter refresh last year, we are continuing with the same groupings this year and turn our focus to how the various groups and some key markets have changed since our previous report. Additional demo- graphic and economic data and more detailed descriptions of these market groups are available online, as listed at the end of this chapter. Magnets Magnet markets are migration destinations for both people and companies, and most are growing more quickly than the U. S. average in terms of both population and jobs. These metro areas are also the preferred markets for investors and builders, with the highest average Overall Real Estate Prospects ratings of any group in the Emerging Trends survey by a wide margin. Collectively, these markets account for almost one-third of the population base in the Emerging Trends coverage universe, the second-largest group in Markets to Watch. Super Sun Belt. These markets are large and diverse but still affordable, forming powerhouse economies that attract a wide range of businesses. Despite their large population bases, most are among the fastest-growing markets in the United States. Moreover, their economic performance has been solid through thick and thin. Though every market lost jobs during the pan- demic recession, recovery has been much quicker and more complete in the Super Sun Belt markets. These metro areas collectively have the highest average rating of any subgroup, as it did last year. 18-Hour Cities.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!167: 3 61.4 38.8 35.0 61.4 51.1 28.1 22.5 44.1 54.7 54.7 54.7 47.0 64.0 Other than household figures, data are for MiamiFort LauderdaleWest Palm Beach, FL.

This group includes the markets sur- rounding high-cost CBDs in Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, San Francisco, and Washington, D. C. Though most are subur- ban in character, some are more urban. Moreover, several are or contain metropolitan statistical areas in their own right. Many of these markets benefited from the out-migration from their neighboring CBDs during the pandemic, and their prospects have improved somewhat in the eyes of survey respondents. But here, too, there is a diversity in trends as seven of the 12 markets improved this year and five declined. Most of the improvement was registered in the New York metropolitan area, while the declining markets are mainly in California. Exhibit 3-9 U. S.

The uneven impact of a return to physical offices in the living with COVID phase of the pandemic shows that investors should avoid projecting their own countrys view of a sector too far away from their home market. For example, office fundamentals remain relatively healthy in Asia and Continental Europe, while they are particularly weak in the US. G LO BA L 4 The balance of virtual and in-person interaction is close to a post-pandemic steady state Most parts of the world have reached the living with COVID phase of the pandemic. One sign of this is that the language around vaccinations has changed. No longer do we talk about being fully vaccinated or not, but about whether we are up-to-date on our seasonal boosters. Case counts continue to ebb and flow, but the incidence of serious health outcomes has fallen precipitously given widespread vaccine-based and natural immunity in most populations. As a result, COVID restrictions have been largely eliminated around the world. In the US and Europe, it is becoming rare to see anyone wearing a mask. Barriers to travel, such as quarantines, have been dropped even in places that once had strict constraints on entry, such as Hong Kong. The big exception to the removal of restrictions is mainland China, where periods of normalcy are interrupted by temporary lockdowns. But even in China, there are signs of change as public health policies continue to evolve. We follow a wide range of data sources to evaluate how close to pre-pandemic normalcy we are. These include Google mobility figures, office keycard entries, seated diners, airline enplanements and public transport ridership. These data indicate that despite a lack of restrictions, the degree of reversion to pre- pandemic norms is incomplete and uneven by activity and location. We divide our observations into work, play and live:  Work: Office attendance remains significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels in many geographies, especially the US, where weekly total keycard entries to office buildings are only 48 of pre-pandemic levels as of November 21, 2022.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!10:  After all, large and growing sections of the populations of the affluent countries of Asia, Europe and North America suffer from these diseases. The willingness and ability to invest large amounts of money in maintaining health is therefore correspondingly strong. An ever increasing number of people worldwide al- so have access to medical care. Life Sciences essentially consist of a combination of various scientific disciplines such as biology, chemistry, medicine and pharmaceuticals. In turn, the main activity of the biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and medical technology segments in focus he- re is research into living organisms. Life Sciences are associated with the develop- ment of economically successful products for human health rather than with funda- mental research. In Germany, biotechnology moved centre stage and gained additi- onal momentum with the approval of the first Covid vaccine. However, the path to producing a market-ready substance is long and fraught with obstacles. Only a fraction of the substances researched are actually successful. To achieve rapid progress, sufficiently large teams are needed. Growth in the number of jobs in Life Sciences is leading to correspondingly higher demand for properties and investment. According to estimates, more than 300,000 people in more than 2,000 companies are employed in the Life Sciences sector in Germany. Biotechnology is the smallest segment, while pharmaceuticals and medical technology employ signifi- cantly more people. The functions of the properties required range from pure offices via laboratories and pharmaceutical logistics to production plants. From our perspec- tive, this combination of office and laboratory  the lab office  is of particular interest to investors.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!8: 4 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021 2023e 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021 2023e LIFE SCIENCES: FOCUS ON HEALTH Research offices are a niche segment, but also a growth market Staying healthy as you age  who wouldnt want that? In simplified terms, this is the motivation driving the booming Life Sciences sector of the economy, which is resear- ching corresponding solutions. However, classic office premises are not appropriate for companies in this segment. Although office space is required for administrative and management functions, the main focus is on laboratory space used by the biolo- gists, chemists and medical staff who are carrying out the research. This combinati- on - the young lab offices segment - is of increasing interest to investors. What lies behind the lab office trend and what potential does it have? The Covid pandemic is a starting point for a review of this segment. It has not only shifted vaccine development into the public focus, but has also brought into the mainstream concepts such as vulnerable and pre-existing conditions to refer to people at risk of serious cases of Covid 19. Because people are living longer thanks to medical progress, these concepts apply to large sections of the population and not just to a small number of people. In 2021 in Germany more than one fifth of the po- pulation  around 18 million people  had reached the age of 65. However, increa- sed life expectancy has not so far been accompanied by improved fitness levels. In fact the opposite is true. A sedentary lifestyle, high-calorie food, ready meals contai- ning a lot of sugar, and the consumption of alcohol and tobacco have consequences, and considerably increase the risk of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, demen- tia, heart attacks, cancer and strokes.

Though growing less affordable over time, these medium-sized cities nonetheless continue to attract in-migration due to lifestyle, workforce quality, and development opportuni- ties, according to ULI interviews. Measured by per capita GMP, workers here are the most productive of any subgroup in the fast-growing Magnets category.

Like the astronomic source for its name, the five metro areas in the Supernova category markets have exploded into prominence over the past decade or so. All are smaller markets with 1 million to 2 million residents, but their defining attribute is their tremendous and sustained population and job growth, which are well above national averages. Despite their relatively modest sizes, all the Supernovas have above-average levels of economic diversity and white-collar employment, which explain their strong investor appeal and should help them sus- tain high growth in the years ahead.

Nonetheless, the glow for this category has faded somewhat as their unfettered growth has invited some big-city problems like congestion and rising living costs. Last years shooting star, Boise, fell sharply after two years in the top 20. Raleigh has continued its modest decline, from the top-rated market in 2021 to number six in the 2023 survey. But more broadly, the Supernovas appear to be suffering some growing pains, as discussed elsewhere in this report. Housing construction is not keeping pace with household growth, strain- ing housing affordability, which has been one of the chief attractions. The Establishment The Establishment markets have long been the nations eco- nomic engines. The 20 markets in this category produce almost 43 percent of the GMP in the 80 Emerging Trends markets while accounting for only 34 percent of its population base. This pri- marily reflects the outsized contributions of the nations gateway markets, which we refer to as the Knowledge and Innovation Centers. Though growing more slowly than the Magnet markets, the Establishment markets still offer tremendous opportunities. This groups average rating is second among our four major group- ings. However, the appeal of these markets to investors and developers has waned in recent years as growth has slowed across many of these markets while challenges have increased. Multitalented Producers. Though all the Establishment markets are large and economically varied, some are more diverse than others, specifically the multitalented metro areas of Chicago, Los Angeles, San Jose, and Seattle. Workers here tend to be productive, with per capita GMP ranking the second highest of any of the subgroups. Though their elevated cost of doing business and getting deals done limits their appeal for some real estate professionals, the Multitalented Producers Exhibit 3-8 U.

Also of note is that many of the Establishment markets that lost population during the pandemic are expected to reverse course and resume growth over the next few years. This growth will be slower than in our other market groups but represents the biggest increase from the recent past to the expected near term. This reversal perhaps accounts for the modest relative improve- ment in the 2023 ratings of the markets in this group. Accordingly, the Magnets have maintained their dominance at the top of the Emerging Trends ratings. Although their average ranking slipped slightly this year, more markets moved up than down. Growth is expected to be greatest in the Supernova subgroup but moderating from its recent torrid pace. For example, popula- tion growth is projected to slow from 1.9 percent annually over the Affordability Matters, Too Quality of life and affordability also matter.

LOOKING AHEAD  The relentless math of higher interest rates will continue to weigh heavily on real estate values, at least until interest rates stabilize as inflation begins to subside. The bid- ask spread for private real estate should eventually close and transactions will resume in earnest at a rebased level.  In the meantime, investment styles that are less sensitive to volatility in values should be contemplated, such as floating-rate lending with a comfortable cushion from lower loan-to-value ratios. Debt investment can be attractive at times of uncertainty, as investors tilt toward contractually certain income and away from an uncertain upside. Portfolio aggregation strategies with smaller asset sizes that lend themselves to averaging-in with diversified timing of entry points represent another way to cope with volatile and uncertain values.  The inputs to the math are not changing to the same degree in every part of the world. Wherever rate spikes are less intense, or the prospects for rental growth are clearest, transaction activity and prices have been less impacted.  In addition to debt costs, investors should also consider the trajectory of cash flows, which depend on economic fundamentals and real estate occupier market conditions. The differential prospects for real estate cash flows are the subject of the next section.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!24:  dollar, while its going up, also confirms that foreigners like to own U.

Too Much for Too Many  Housing affordability has fallen to its lowest level in over 30 years. Prices and rents have soared relative to incomes. Spiraling mortgage rates have pushed the homeownership bar further out of reach for a growing share of households.  The chronic undersupply of housing is the result of govern- ment policies that limit new supply or increase construction costs and is exacerbated by a labor shortage, as well as NIMBYism.  Simply constructing more housing may be the most obvious and effective solution, but is far from easy to achieve. Housing is too expensive. It has been that way for too longfor too many people neither for-sale nor rental housing is afford- ablebut prices and rents have soared even further out of reach over the course of the past year. And even if we experi- ence an economic downturn, as many economists expect, it is not projected to provide significant relief. It starts with record home prices. The U. S. median existing- home price jumped by over 18 percent in 2021 alonethe largest increase on record going back to the early 1950s and then tacked on a further 15 percent through mid-2022. Combined with rapidly rising mortgage rates, housing afford- ability has fallen to its lowest level in over 30 years relative to incomes, according to the National Association of Realtors.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!27: 1 Changes to building codes over the past 10 years Sources: National Association of Home Builders. National Multifamily Housing Council. confidence suggests that that decline will likely continue until the interest rate environment turns more favorable. to a report from economists at the Fed, perhaps a reaction to lockdown claustrophobia. And the homes that do get built are expensive, particularly since the pandemic. Construction costs shot up due to supply chain disruptions and are still worrisome. As one housing industry adviser notes, Theres a stress index about global supply chains, and those stress indices are all indicating that theyre moderating, but theyre still at very high levels. Finally, high permitting fees and utility charges and large minimum lot sizes push developers to build more expensive homes. Renters Priced Out of the Homebuying Market With a growing share of households priced out of the for-sale market, demand for rental units is far outstripping new supply. Though population growth slowed sharply during the pandemic, demand is also rising from the many young adults eager to start their own households after moving back in with their parents during COVID. Further boosting demand is the increasing number of younger adults choosing to live alone, according The multifamily sector has responded with an unprecedented increase in new supply. Weve built more multifamily housing units over the last 10 years than we had in any other time since 1980, notes an adviser to institutional investors. But it is still far less than needed. Vacancies have fallen to their lowest levels ever while rents are rising faster than evereven faster than home prices. And though not a formal part of the affordability calculations, other housing-related costs like utilities and main- tenance are also rising faster than incomes, further constraining the ability of households to afford basic shelter. Moving to More Affordable Recent slowdowns in rent growth and home price appreciation, noted in our Normalizing trend, have done little to increase affordability. So how to address this? Millions of people have taken matters into their own hands.;\n\nreal_estate_index:bouwinvest_international-market-outlook_2023-2025-1.pdf-!9:  Several challenges warrant close monitoring, however. Persistently high U. S. inflation is diminishing the affordability of index-linked rental accommodation. Rent controls are uncommon, except in some coastal states, but the public debate on regulating more rental housing is heating up. Construction costs are climbing on the back of wage and raw materials price hikes, creating additional risks for early-stage housing schemes. At the same time a decline in the volume of new developments could shore up the valuations of existing stock. As in Europe, the long-term average spread between residential real estate and risk-free government bond yields is above current spread levels . The rising cost of debt and the narrowing gap between real estate yields and the risk-free rate is expected to result in asset repricing, potentially generating opportunities for non-leveraged investors.

After more than a decade of lower for longer, the Fed is finally normalizing interest rates closer to historical levels. Those rising interest rates are already driving up debt costs and thus the costs to acquire and develop property, reducing leveraged returns. At the same time, the federal government is done with providing stimulus, indirectly reducing tenant demand for space. Unlike in the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and during the pandemic, nobodys coming to the rescue, and now we got to take our medicine, and here it comes, says the head of research for an investment management firm. Thus, the government is turning off both the monetary and fiscal spigots that had been support- ing commercial real estate and the economy overall. The head of a development company summarized it like this: I feel like weve been on a little bit of a sugar high with this stimu- lus and cheap debt. Theres going to be a slowdown. Theres got to be this normalization. So, what does that mean? I think its going to be a little bouncy. Its going to be a little bit turbulent. But then we bottom out, and we start back into growth. 2.  Still, Weve Changed Some  The pandemic forced structural shifts in how and where we live, work, and recreate in ways that seem destinated to endure.  Online spending is receding from its pandemic peaks but is not likely to revert to pre-pandemic levels. Business travel is unlikely to recover to pre-COVID levels for at least several years, meaning business hotels, fine dining, and conference facilities will continue to face challenges.  The greatest changes may be in how and where we work. The impact on office use and leasing is still evolving, and a significant share of the existing stock may need to be reposi- tioned to remain competitive.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!9:  Defying just about every prediction voiced during the terrifying and uncertain days of the COVID lockdown that began in March 2020, U. S. commercial property markets actually embarked on a remarkable run, with some of the strongest returns, rent growth, and price appreciation rates ever recorded. Not every property type, however: hotels endured their worst and most sustained downturn in memory, while offices suffered an unprecedented and significant cut in usage of space. And not every market: some of the nations strongest gateway mar- kets, like New York City and San Francisco, experienced sharp outflows of residents, businesses, and tenants of all types. But overall and across much of the United States, property markets far outperformed expectations and historical norms. And now, more than two years on, property investors and managers are learning anew that whopping growth and profits eventually fall back to eartha reversion to the mean, to use finance jargon, or simply normalizing, as numerous industry experts we interviewed put it. Some looming market adjustments will be cyclical due to the weakening economic conditions that most economists and real estate professionals expect, while others represent more of a return to normalcy after all the pandemic-fueled market distortions. These market reversions will take several forms: prices of most assets are declining as cap rates rise and transaction volumes fall from record levels, while rent gains for others are merely moderating as demand returns to more sustainable levels. Perhaps the biggest surprise is that these reversals of fortune are hitting favored property sectors like multifamily and indus- trial. That does not necessarily mean the market corrections will be painful. In many cases, recent losses in property value will only trim already healthy gains. But many indicators suggest that the (really) good times may be over, at least for a while. Housing Set to Cool A finance executive with one national homebuilder told us, Were still selling. Its just not at the pace that it was selling before the last two years, which was a pace that you dont typi- cally see. So, the markets are more normalizing.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!8:  These conditions would be problematic for property markets: slowing or falling economic growth dampens tenant demand, while higher interest rates raise the cost of developing or acquiring properties. Both factors would cut returns and reduce values. Indeed, rising interest rates and uncertainty over future market conditions are already killing deals since sellers have not been ready to capitulate to buyers growing demands for price concessions, as we discuss in our capital markets trend. New Horizons Still, not all recessions are alike, and most economists, as well as Emerging Trends interviewees, expect any recession to be relatively short and shallow. Reflecting the view of several CRE leaders we interviewed, a senior executive with a global devel- opment and investment firm said, My gut says were going to have a recession, but its going to be relatively mild compared to some of the more severe recessions weve had. I dont see anything like the 2008 economic downturn going on. One leading CRE economist went so far as to say, I think were going into what I would say is a healthy down cycle. Its a cleansing, Schumpeterian idea that every so often, economies property markets includedneed to cleanse, and it washes out bad ideas, it washes out unrealistic unsustainable values. That reset presents new opportunities, even as it introduces uncertainty. Says the CEO of a development company, I think this is a moment in time. And when I look back historically, and I did not act in these moments in time, Ive always regretted it. The 10 emerging trends that we expect for 2023 and beyond follow: 1. Normalizing  Property market fundamentals are normalizing as some markets weaken due to diminishing pandemic tailwinds and the potential for a cyclical economic downturn. Exhibit 1-3 Importance of Issues for Real Estate in 2023 1 No importance 3 Moderate importance 5 Great importance  Some property sectors may cool, including residential and industrial, while others may heat up to historical average levels, such as hotels and retail.  Returns and prices of most assets are declining as cap rates rise and transaction volumes fall from record levels, while rent gains for others are merely moderating as demand returns to a more sustainable pace.;\n\nreal_estate_index:global-real-estate-markets-2023.pdf-!1:  We also dive into student housing in the US, another sector booming among investors, and what impact demographic trends might have on it. In addition, we analyze how opportunistic and value-add managers will need to adopt their strategies now that interest rates are higher, and how their ability to generate out-size returns simply by adding leverage is gone. So, a number of important topics for us and investors to consider. We hope you find our answers insightful and useful in determining your strategy and thinking about some of the key questions in real estate as we move into the new year. Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy. Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs. We have already started to see cap rates and yields rise in many markets, with the most rapid adjustment taking place in the UK. However, we do not think that prices fully reflect higher interest rates yet. To assess when values might bottom out, we can look to past downturns and the listed market for guidance. In the Global Financial Crisis, for example, global capital values bottomed out in 4Q09, while GDP across global real estate markets troughed three quarters earlier, in 1Q09, as did global listed real estate prices1. Market downturns usually present opportunities, and one we expect for investors in 2023 is a correction in pricing as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. Although we do not expect large amounts of distress in the market, we do expect some, already apparent in parts of the UK market. This should allow investors access to assets at attractive pricing. The early 1990s downturn was longer, with US capital values continuing to decline into 1995. We expect modest declines in GDP in the first half of 2023 before growth resumes.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, both sources concur that there is a reversion to the norm occurring within the markets.\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

In simplified terms, this is the motivation driving the booming Life Sciences sector of the economy, which is resear- ching corresponding solutions. However, classic office premises are not appropriate for companies in this segment. Although office space is required for administrative and management functions, the main focus is on laboratory space used by the biolo- gists, chemists and medical staff who are carrying out the research. This combinati- on - the young lab offices segment - is of increasing interest to investors. What lies behind the lab office trend and what potential does it have? The Covid pandemic is a starting point for a review of this segment. It has not only shifted vaccine development into the public focus, but has also brought into the mainstream concepts such as vulnerable and pre-existing conditions to refer to people at risk of serious cases of Covid 19. Because people are living longer thanks to medical progress, these concepts apply to large sections of the population and not just to a small number of people. In 2021 in Germany more than one fifth of the po- pulation  around 18 million people  had reached the age of 65. However, increa- sed life expectancy has not so far been accompanied by improved fitness levels. In fact the opposite is true. A sedentary lifestyle, high-calorie food, ready meals contai- ning a lot of sugar, and the consumption of alcohol and tobacco have consequences, and considerably increase the risk of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, demen- tia, heart attacks, cancer and strokes. The growing number of older people suffering ill health is also a significant economic factor.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!10:  After all, large and growing sections of the populations of the affluent countries of Asia, Europe and North America suffer from these diseases. The willingness and ability to invest large amounts of money in maintaining health is therefore correspondingly strong. An ever increasing number of people worldwide al- so have access to medical care. Life Sciences essentially consist of a combination of various scientific disciplines such as biology, chemistry, medicine and pharmaceuticals. In turn, the main activity of the biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and medical technology segments in focus he- re is research into living organisms. Life Sciences are associated with the develop- ment of economically successful products for human health rather than with funda- mental research. In Germany, biotechnology moved centre stage and gained additi- onal momentum with the approval of the first Covid vaccine. However, the path to producing a market-ready substance is long and fraught with obstacles. Only a fraction of the substances researched are actually successful. To achieve rapid progress, sufficiently large teams are needed. Growth in the number of jobs in Life Sciences is leading to correspondingly higher demand for properties and investment. According to estimates, more than 300,000 people in more than 2,000 companies are employed in the Life Sciences sector in Germany. Biotechnology is the smallest segment, while pharmaceuticals and medical technology employ signifi- cantly more people. The functions of the properties required range from pure offices via laboratories and pharmaceutical logistics to production plants. From our perspec- tive, this combination of office and laboratory  the lab office  is of particular interest to investors.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!94:  Some functions such as computer programming or data entry are performed easily at home, while for other jobs personal interaction is critical to productivity. There is no one-size-fits-all solutionnot by company, not by industry, not by location. It all depends on the function within companies, said a senior research executive. Little Consensus beyond Hybrid The future of work is hybrid. Surveys indicate that the average office employee will work in person three to 3.5 days a week, reflecting the tug-of-war between employers and employees.

The Importance of Older Buildings In her classic 1961 urban planning treatise, The Death and Life of Great American Cities, Jane Jacobs elucidates the critical ingredients for a diverse, vibrant city. Among them is one rule that may seem puzzling at first: The district must mingle build- ings that vary in age and condition, including a good proportion of old ones. Why the need for old buildings? Why not all new? If a city area has only new buildings, the enterprises that can exist there are automatically limited to those that can support the high costs of new construction. How boring and monotonous that would be. Jacobs points to all the small local businesses that occupy these older structures that give the neighborhood its diversity and vitality. Although Jacobs doesnt say it precisely, there is another crucial observation regarding the importance of older buildings: so many of them find new life with uses different from their original function. Walk around the bustling old port districts of Montreal or Boston or Portland, Maine, and you will find hundreds of for- mer warehouses that have been repurposed into upscale hotels, cool offices, hip restaurants, and distinctive retail spaces. Conversions are hardly limited to old warehouse districts. Every vibrant downtown is filled with buildings of varying types and vintages that have been converted into new uses. Often the conversions go upstream, as lower-value land uses like ware- houses convert into higher-value uses like office or retail. But the direction is often reversed, with old offices converting into artist space or storage. Lemonade from Lemons Demographic trends and structural demand shifts magnified by the pandemic have rendered countless existing buildings either redundant or obsolete . But manythough not allof these can be either repurposed or upgraded to meet new market standards. The many opportunities include the following: 18  Converting older offices to residential uses, or upgrading them into modern offices, where feasible and supported by the market.  Repurposing excess retail space for other uses or improving with mixed use. And  Scraping buildings to create development land where con- version is not feasible, or where density can be increased, to site new housing.;\n***\n[Submission]: Answer: The heart is a vital organ that pumps blood throughout the body, delivering oxygen and nutrients to the cells and removing carbon dioxide and other waste products.

Calls that inflation and rates were peaking or transitory proved wrong again and again. The rise in inflation has spread beyond volatile commodities into core parts of the economy . Wherever real estate occupational markets have been tight enough to give landlords pricing power, which mercifully is the case in many cities and sectors across the globe, real estate cash flows have benefited from inflation. However, this is a reminder that real estate can act as both a hedge for and a source of inflation.

There will likely also be lasting ramifications for the project of European integration, with outcomes depending on whether European nation-states decide to share the burden or go it alone. It may also reset relations between governments and their people, whose expectations for state intervention to avert negative economic outcomes have rarely been higher. Sharing challenges like inflation, climate change, currency stability, Russian aggression, refugee relief and energy policy may realign UK and EU policies to a greater degree than at any time since the Brexit vote. In real estate terms, the major markets of Europe are highly varied. Yet, when viewed from a global perspective, they are quite like one another in terms of their focus on green building policies, reliance on public transport, cautious approach to new supply and their proximity to an armed conflict.

The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated huge government fiscal interventions to support consumers and businesses through periods of mandated closure. These came on the heels of a decade in which sovereign debt crises and austerity had already seen productivity growth stagnate without meaningfully improving sovereign balance sheets in peripheral Europe. Reopening as the pandemic entered the endemic phase saw supply chain stresses and uneven demand patterns drive shortfalls in the availability of goods and labor. The energy supply crunch resulting from European support for Ukraine added a huge exogenous cost shock to the existing global and regional price pressure, driving European inflation readings to the highest level in the world by the end of 2022, on top of the future costs of new commitments to defense spending. The war in Ukraine will eventually end, but barring an unexpected change in Russian leadership, the deflationary impact of its cheap natural gas to heat homes and power industry will not return.;\n\nreal_estate_index:2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf-!20:  Although customers are now returning to the high street in greater numbers as Covid measures are relaxed, many no longer have as much money to spend. Inflation has reached levels not seen for decades. In addition to significantly higher food, petrol and diesel prices, heating costs are imposing a particularly heavy financial burden on many households. Nor is the pandemic over yet.

This applies mainly to gas which, unlike oil, is not readily available in the world market. Gas prices have exploded because only a fraction of the supply vo- lume is now being delivered, with an adverse impact on consumers and the econo- my. There is also the risk of a complete suspension of the supply. Households and businesses are consequently being urged to conserve energy.

This is reflected in consumer sentiment which has fallen to a historic low. The GfK survey shows that income expectations have slumped to an even greater degree than the propensity to buy. This is bad news for city centre retail in two respects, with the need to make savings driving consumer spending down further. Nominal wages are rising comparatively strongly in 2022, however the growth is being more than offset by high inflation, probably of an annual average rate close to 8 per cent. Below the line, spending power is falling significantly, much more steeply than in the last three decades. While low inflation has supported retail activity since 2012 in the form of real wage growth, the opposite is now the case. Busy shopping centres and restaurants convey a different picture. However, house- holds are reluctant to spend. The German Federal Statistical Office reported an infla- tion-adjusted decline of 9 per cent in retail sales in June 2022 compared to the same month last year. Consequently, nominal and real retail sales diverged sharply at mid- year. The music sector is another example. Tickets for some concerts are selling so slowly that tours have already been cancelled.

Inflationary pressures have been unleashed by pandemic-related supply chain challenges, the frictions of a stop-start reopening, vast fiscal stimulus and pent-up consumer savings. The impact of these is being exacerbated by a war on Europes periphery that is creating havoc with commodity markets, especially those for energy, chemicals and basic grains. This has led to a rise in inflation, which has spread beyond volatile commodities into core parts of the economy. This has caused a slowdown in transactions and a bid-ask spread has emerged in many markets. The war in Ukraine has also shown how heavily dependent Germany is on Russian energy supplies, leading to high energy prices and an additional gas levy of 2.4 cents per kWh. This has caused consumer sentiment to fall to a historic low, with income expectations slumping to an even greater degree than the propensity to buy. This has resulted in an inflation-adjusted decline of 9% in retail sales in June 2022 compared to the same month last year.\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.

LOOKING AHEAD  The relentless math of higher interest rates will continue to weigh heavily on real estate values, at least until interest rates stabilize as inflation begins to subside. The bid- ask spread for private real estate should eventually close and transactions will resume in earnest at a rebased level.  In the meantime, investment styles that are less sensitive to volatility in values should be contemplated, such as floating-rate lending with a comfortable cushion from lower loan-to-value ratios. Debt investment can be attractive at times of uncertainty, as investors tilt toward contractually certain income and away from an uncertain upside. Portfolio aggregation strategies with smaller asset sizes that lend themselves to averaging-in with diversified timing of entry points represent another way to cope with volatile and uncertain values.  The inputs to the math are not changing to the same degree in every part of the world. Wherever rate spikes are less intense, or the prospects for rental growth are clearest, transaction activity and prices have been less impacted.  In addition to debt costs, investors should also consider the trajectory of cash flows, which depend on economic fundamentals and real estate occupier market conditions. The differential prospects for real estate cash flows are the subject of the next section.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!13:  More than half believe that capitalization rates are heading up next year and returns are coming down, primarily due to rising interest rates and cost of capital, which was the top economic concern voiced in our survey. After more than a decade of lower for longer, the Fed is finally normalizing interest rates closer to historical levels. Those rising interest rates are already driving up debt costs and thus the costs to acquire and develop property, reducing leveraged returns. At the same time, the federal government is done with providing stimulus, indirectly reducing tenant demand for space. Unlike in the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and during the pandemic, nobodys coming to the rescue, and now we got to take our medicine, and here it comes, says the head of research for an investment management firm. Thus, the government is turning off both the monetary and fiscal spigots that had been support- ing commercial real estate and the economy overall. The head of a development company summarized it like this: I feel like weve been on a little bit of a sugar high with this stimu- lus and cheap debt. Theres going to be a slowdown. Theres got to be this normalization. So, what does that mean? I think its going to be a little bouncy. Its going to be a little bit turbulent. But then we bottom out, and we start back into growth. 2.  Still, Weve Changed Some  The pandemic forced structural shifts in how and where we live, work, and recreate in ways that seem destinated to endure.  Online spending is receding from its pandemic peaks but is not likely to revert to pre-pandemic levels. Business travel is unlikely to recover to pre-COVID levels for at least several years, meaning business hotels, fine dining, and conference facilities will continue to face challenges.  The greatest changes may be in how and where we work. The impact on office use and leasing is still evolving, and a significant share of the existing stock may need to be reposi- tioned to remain competitive.;\n\nreal_estate_index:global-real-estate-markets-2023.pdf-!1:  We also dive into student housing in the US, another sector booming among investors, and what impact demographic trends might have on it. In addition, we analyze how opportunistic and value-add managers will need to adopt their strategies now that interest rates are higher, and how their ability to generate out-size returns simply by adding leverage is gone. So, a number of important topics for us and investors to consider. We hope you find our answers insightful and useful in determining your strategy and thinking about some of the key questions in real estate as we move into the new year. Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns. This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy. Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs. We have already started to see cap rates and yields rise in many markets, with the most rapid adjustment taking place in the UK. However, we do not think that prices fully reflect higher interest rates yet. To assess when values might bottom out, we can look to past downturns and the listed market for guidance. In the Global Financial Crisis, for example, global capital values bottomed out in 4Q09, while GDP across global real estate markets troughed three quarters earlier, in 1Q09, as did global listed real estate prices1. Market downturns usually present opportunities, and one we expect for investors in 2023 is a correction in pricing as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. Although we do not expect large amounts of distress in the market, we do expect some, already apparent in parts of the UK market. This should allow investors access to assets at attractive pricing. The early 1990s downturn was longer, with US capital values continuing to decline into 1995. We expect modest declines in GDP in the first half of 2023 before growth resumes.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!20:  10 Exhibit 1-6 Availability of Capital for Real Estate, 2023 versus 2022 2023 2022 Lending source Nonbank nancial institutions Debt funds Government-sponsored enterprises Insurance companies Mortgage REITs Commercial banks Securitized lendersCMBS Equity source Private-equityopportunity hedge funds Foreign investors Private REITs Private local investors Institutional investors pension funds Public-equity REITs 3.05 3.44 2.99 3.26 2.97 3.39 2.83 3.44 2.72 3.42 2.58 3.63 2.56 3.61 3.18 3.74 3.09 3.54 3.00 3.59 2.98 3.66 2.89 3.67 2.73 3.40 2023 2022 1 2 Large decline 3 Stay the same 4 5 Large increase Source: Emerging Trends in Real Estate surveys. Note: Based on U. S. respondents only. Says the regional leader of one global firm, Cap rates have gapped out as interest rates went up. And suddenly, things didnt pencil, and that generated broken deals. The cost of financing for real estate and everything else went up dramatically. And so everything has to be repriced, everything has to be reset. Also limiting investor demand: debt is getting more difficult to obtain, and the Emerging Trends survey expects underwriting standards to get even more rigorous. As the partner in one lead- ing advisory firm explains, This is one of those cash is king situations where borrowing costs are higher, and if youre an all- cash buyer, those probably represent a disproportionate share of the people in the market today. Meanwhile, the same interest rate increases that reduce lever- aged returns and thus demand for real estate also make bonds and other interest-bearing investments more compelling. As the head of real estate banking at one investment bank explains, Rising bond yields are going to mean that real estate and other alternatives are all going to be facing less availability of capital and some outflows.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, the increase in capitalization rates and the decrease in returns observed in the U.S. property market are associated with rising interest rates and cost of capital.

Investors should be patient but prepared to act as opportunities materialize. In the meantime, floating rate debt investment at defensive loan-to-value ratios represents an attractive strategy. Debt re- pricing is nearly instantaneous, while equity re-pricing takes time.  The equilibrium state of monetary policy will require more private capital to participate in the construction of productivity-enhancing infrastructure, such as life sciences facilities, logistics and decarbonizing the value chain. Governments can ill afford another lost decade, but neither can they borrow at scale to finance large infrastructure spending.  Focus on a narrower group of cities, rich in human capital, which will do better economically thanks to tech-heavy industries and services, light manufacturing and tourism. This is not confined only to large cities but includes stand-out secondary markets such as Bristol in the UK and a range of innovative university cities.  Prospects for income growth will be strongest for the best-located assets of a given type for example, offices in vibrant mixed-use zones or logistics assets on crossroads of multiple trans-modal routesand for assets with strong green credentials. We anticipate high levels of bifurcation within property types based on quality.;\n\nreal_estate_index:bouwinvest_international-market-outlook_2023-2025-1.pdf-!5:  Broker reports indicate that prime yields already started to move out in some locations between Q1 2022 and Q2 2022, with German cities leading the pack at 30bps. French and Spanish cities posted quarter-on-quarter yield increases of between 15 and 25bps. As risk-free rates are up and expected to remain elevated between 2023 and 2025, we believe office capital values could soften further during the outlook period, and we estimate prime yields in Europe will move out by another 50bps. This would amount to a value loss of around 10 to 15 before stabilization and recovery takes place. Office transaction volumes in Europe already fell by over 20 during Q2 2022 compared with the same year-earlier period. Bouwinvest Outlook 2023-2025 9 Europe Logistics Covid-19 had a surprisingly positive effect on European logistics markets with the accelerated adoption of online shopping more than offsetting the economic turmoil. Now that the pandemic appears to be largely under control, the pace of e-commerce growth has eased, but is still positive and the potential for further expansion remains strong as consumers service expectations continue to evolve and drive demand for logistics properties. reluctance among municipalities to issue land for new logistic space. We expect this latter trend to continue in the coming years, with Germany and France currently showing the most resistance to new greenfield developments. As a result, nominal rental growth, although slowing down, is expected to remain positive during the outlook period at a figure just shy of 3.0 per annum. Global supply chain disruption following the pandemic and ongoing geopolitical tensions are also fuelling a supply chain reconfiguration with a greater emphasis on onshoring over just-in-time. This is boosting domestic demand for logistics real estate and helping to ease wider supply chain pressures. European economic support programmes running until 2027 and totalling 1.1 trillion are expected to provide another boost to the sector. The volume of new supply coming to market is meanwhile decreasing due to both rising construction costs and a Capital values of prime logistics properties are forecast to decline by an average 7-8 in Q4 2022 compared with Q4 2021 levels.;\n\nreal_estate_index:bouwinvest_international-market-outlook_2023-2025-1.pdf-!4:  Net Initial Yield Gap European Gateway Cities Residential Source: Oxford Economics, baseline scenario , Green Street 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 -100 205 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Spread vs Average Yield (RHS) Eurozone Average Interest rate, 10-Yr Government Bond Yield Amsterdam Berlin London Paris Historic Average Spread (RHS) Bouwinvest Outlook 2023-2025 8 Europe Office Europes highly diverse and heterogeneous office market is currently experiencing a great deal of uncertainty. Rental growth and yield spreads vary significantly between prime, sustainable office assets and secondary stock. Office job numbers are growing but increased working from home (WFH) is likely to have a strong effect on structural demand. Well-located, sustainable, prime CBD offices with good connectivity, access to diverse labour pools and agglomeration benefits, will remain attractive. Such grade A assets can play an important role in maintaining a common corporate culture, personal skill development and networking. Nevertheless, we expect minimal real rental growth during the outlook period, even at the leading prime locations. Like residential properties, office rental contracts also generally have an inflation-linked component. However, persistently high inflation has already started to affect the affordability of index-linked rental properties and office tenants that are under pressure may seek to renegotiate their leases. The European office market is characterised by a large variety of rental contracts and if rental increases are staggered, for example, inflation cannot be passed on fully. At the time of writing, there is little market evidence of repricing of privately owned prime offices, but we estimate that average- quality office values may have fallen by roughly 15 by the end of Q4 2022 since their peak at the end of 2021. This amounts to a yield expansion of about 50bps. A yield correction is also on the cards for prime offices in Europe, but the increase is likely to be more moderate.;\n\nreal_estate_index:bouwinvest_international-market-outlook_2023-2025-1.pdf-!2:  has so far raised its interest rates even more aggressively, leading to a weakening of the exchange rates of the euro and pound sterling.

We expect more downward revisions to valuations in the next six to eight quarters, driven by rising interest rates. Should economic conditions deteriorate further, vacancy levels will go up and rental growth will slacken, accelerating a flight to quality among investors.

Further boosting demand is the increasing number of younger adults choosing to live alone, according The multifamily sector has responded with an unprecedented increase in new supply. Weve built more multifamily housing units over the last 10 years than we had in any other time since 1980, notes an adviser to institutional investors. But it is still far less than needed. Vacancies have fallen to their lowest levels ever while rents are rising faster than evereven faster than home prices. And though not a formal part of the affordability calculations, other housing-related costs like utilities and main- tenance are also rising faster than incomes, further constraining the ability of households to afford basic shelter. Moving to More Affordable Recent slowdowns in rent growth and home price appreciation, noted in our Normalizing trend, have done little to increase affordability. So how to address this? Millions of people have taken matters into their own hands.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!170: 45 4.44 4.43 3.95 3.75 3.59 3.56 3.55 3.55 3.51 3.33 3.23 3.11 2.93 2.91 Source: Emerging Trends in Real Estate 2023 survey. Note: Based on Canadian respondents only. 92 To be sure, the current environment offers relief from the intense bidding competition of recent years, which was also creating challenges for real estate companies. But for now, the height- ened uncertainty is leading many players to stay on the sidelines as they wait to see where the market, particularly when it comes to pricing and valuations, settles. One interviewee noted their cautious approach when they said that they were sticking to the fairway, not trying to clear the trees and skip the dogleg, when it comes to deployment decisions. Cost Escalations amid Supply Chain Challenges and Labor Shortages On top of concerns about the capital markets are supply chain shortages and delays as well as significant increases in costs for labor and materials. Labor issues have been a challenge for some time, but rising costs and shortages of inputs including for key materials like steelhave added to the pressures. According to Statistics Canada, residential building costs were up 22.6 percent on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter of 2022. For nonresidential construction, cost increases were lower but still significant at 12.8 percent. Construction cost increases continued into the second quarter of 2022 amid inflationary pressures throughout the economy. Rising labor shortages are exacerbating the challenges. According to Statistics Canada, construction job vacancies reached a record high in the first quarter of 2022 and were double the number of open positions during the same period in 2020. And then there is the impact of construction wages, which were up 6.6 percent in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2021. All of this has made completing projects on time and on budget even harder than in the past, and the situation is unlikely to improve in the foreseeable future.;\n\nreal_estate_index:Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf-!88:  As supply begins to come online, rent growth is expected to deceleratefirst, in untested sub- markets with elevated pipelines. Higher-barrier locations, on the other hand, may sustain higher rent growth for longer. Construction Is Battling Supply Chain Issues Real estate developers across the United States are confronting rising construction costs. Steel, concrete, and roofing materials contribute up to 80 percent of typical shell costs. Market price surges since the end of 2019 for these, and other major catego- ries, caused finished construction costs to spike by 50 percent. Construction durations in the broader industry have increased by two to three months, on average, since 2019, due to lon- ger material lead times and increasing contractor backlogs, according to a construction director at a large industrial owner. Advanced material procurement strategies and construction technology can resolve some ongoing construction issues. Developers are moving upstream in the value chain by lever- aging direct partnerships with national material suppliers to pre-secure and prioritize long-lead building materials and mitigate material shortages where possible. Developers are also introducing modularized construction systems to expedite repeatable project elements, such as office tenant improve- ments and in-warehouse restrooms, which reduce on-site construction timelines.

In the favourable case, clean-up costs will be lower in the next decade than they are today due to economies of scale and technological progress. Given the generally high importance of the housing market and the great earning potential for successful renovators, decisive progress should be possible here. Last but not least, this strategy could also make sense from a climate policy point of view, as the optimal renovation time, 17 April 21, 2023 Germany Monitor 2023 Housing market outlook Temperature difference during summer BerlinBrandenburg vs. Schleswig-Holstein Celsius defined as the minimum sum of all CO2 emissions of a building, could be beyond this decade, at least assuming significant economies of scale and efficiency gains. 39 5.6 Climatic changes and impacts on the housing market To date, climatic location factors have played a small role for investors. This could change as the climate crisis worsens, with both direct and indirect effects on housing demand. In regions with a higher likelihood of extreme weather events, housing demand is reduced due to a lower quality of life. For example, there could be a direct negative impact from rationing water to water the garden or fill up the swimming pool in the more arid regions. Fires are also more likely and tend to increase there. Heavily damaged forests or fields are also likely to dampen demand for housing, especially if such events become more frequent and nature fails to fully regenerate. Demand is also likely to fall in regions that are increasingly affected by floods and inundations. The indirect effects on demand for housing could be even more significant. For example, entire value chains could be broken and business models rendered unprofitable if infrastructure is damaged by heat, dried-up rivers or fires. As prices and rents rise in line with incomes in the long term, rents in the affected regions could rise or fall less sharply. Regions that will be less affected by extreme weather events in the future, on the other hand, could experience higher demand, prices, and rents. Much information is lacking to estimate which regions are more likely to be winners and losers.;\n***\n[Submission]: Yes, there has been an escalation in the expenses related to building and refurbishing houses, due to problems like supply chain interruptions. According to , construction costs shot up due to supply chain disruptions and are still worrisome. Additionally, according to , market price surges since the end of 2019 for key materials like steel have caused finished construction costs to spike by 50 percent. Furthermore, according to , costs could rise disproportionately due to the shortage of labor and skilled workers.\n***\n[Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided.
