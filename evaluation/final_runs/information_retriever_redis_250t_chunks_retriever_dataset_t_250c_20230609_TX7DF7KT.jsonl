Ulrich Hller on the expectations for 2023: We can see a number of signals that might indicate a waning in the momentum of inflation, interest rates, energy as well as material and construction costs. However, we do not expect a sustainable trend reversal before 2024, by which time the economy should also be picking up speed again. Ulrich Hller on the development of rental prices: Existing rents will increase for two main reasons: rents for commercial real estate are usually index-linked. Taking into account the high inflation rates, this means that rents will increase accordingly. At the same time, the reduced number of development projects will increase the demand for existing properties, therefore putting further upwards pressure on rents. In particular, rents for objects in sought-after locations as well as for high-quality and energy-efficient properties will increase significantly because supply will not be able to meet demand in the foreseeable future. The so-called global war for talent, in which the working environment has become a key competitive factor, further adds to this.

Inflation would remain high through 2022, but gradually settle around 2 by mid-2023 as demand for goods subsides in favor of services, helping businesses alleviate supply chain issues. The Federal Reserve would raise rates to combat inflation through 2022, but slow rate increases as inflation normalizes. Other, less likely scenarios include: (1) Back to the 1970s (25) where businesses raise prices and wages in lockstep and there is sustained high inflation. (2) COVID-19 relapse (5) in which vaccines become ineffective, and lockdowns are again imposed. And (3) Next recession (15), triggered by overly aggressive tightening of monetary policy as governments attempt to tame inflation. Regardless of which scenario comes to fruition, the 2023 Deloitte real estate outlook survey reveals that concerns about the economy are top of mind for most global real estate leaders as they prepare for the remainder of 2022 and 2023 .

Ulrich Hller on the development of rental prices: Existing rents will increase for two main reasons: rents for commercial real estate are usually index-linked. Taking into account the high inflation rates, this means that rents will increase accordingly. At the same time, the reduced number of development projects will increase the demand for existing properties, therefore putting further upwards pressure on rents.

But can the Federal Reserve Bank tame inflation without breaking the economy? Moderating inflation rates this summer led many to believe that the worst was over and that the Fed could soon ease up its con- tractionary monetary policy. Indeed, the consensus of experts we interviewed this summer was that the Fed would cease tightening by the end of 2022 and start cutting rates again in mid-2023. That sentiment now appears optimistic. Inflation is going to be a little stickier than people think, said an investment banking executive we interviewed during the summer, whose views turned out to be more prescient. Sentiment started changing in late August when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell gave his annual speech to fellow central bankers affirming the Fed view that infla- tion is not nearly under control, jolting markets.

The Federal Reserve would raise rates to combat inflation through 2022, but slow rate increases as inflation normalizes.

This prompted central banks to make aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022, with more expected in 2023, along with a mild recession in the economy. Looking back to our 2022 predictions, in general they proved prescient. We expected hybrid working to weigh on the office market and that the polarization between the best and worst assets would continue, which has been the case. We expected retail capital values to bottom out, which they had started to, but are now likely to be impacted by weakening consumer spending. We said that property investors would no longer be able to rely on market-driven yield compression to drive returns, which has certainly proved accurate as the market adjusts to higher interest rates.

In-person office attendance remains substantially below that of other regions, with limited prospects for near-term improvement. N O R T H A M E R I CA The US and Canadian economies and real estate markets are dealing with the global challenges of high inflation, higher interest rates and dimming economic growth outlooks in similar ways. Both also enter 2023 with economies that are still growing and real estate fundamentals largely in balance. There are challenges, but the medium- to long-term outlook remains brighter than the outlook for the near-term. Real estate investors need strategies that are resilient to an expected volatile environment in 2023 and take advantage of the opportunities emerging from volatility. Stubbornly high inflation The root cause of market challenges heading into 2023 is elevated inflation. The US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada have both made lowering inflation their top priority, but it remains stubbornly high in both markets. This led to policy rates increasing from effectively zero to over four percent by year end. The increase in policy rates has been mirrored in long-term rates and in real estate borrowing rates. The impact has been a dramatic shift in the direction of property values, from a rapid rise in 2021 and early 2022, to a fall in the second half of 2022.", "filename": "isa-outlook-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy. Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs. We have already started to see cap rates and yields rise in many markets, with the most rapid adjustment taking place in the UK. However, we do not think that prices fully reflect higher interest rates yet. To assess when values might bottom out, we can look to past downturns and the listed market for guidance. In the Global Financial Crisis, for example, global capital values bottomed out in 4Q09, while GDP across global real estate markets troughed three quarters earlier, in 1Q09, as did global listed real estate prices1. Market downturns usually present opportunities, and one we expect for investors in 2023 is a correction in pricing as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. Although we do not expect large amounts of distress in the market, we do expect some, already apparent in parts of the UK market. This should allow investors access to assets at attractive pricing. The early 1990s downturn was longer, with US capital values continuing to decline into 1995.

In an August 2022 survey by the National Association of Business Economics, only a quarter of economists were even somewhat confident that the Fed could bring down inflation to its target range without causing a recession. Worrying signs out of Europe in early autumn and expectations of soaring heating bills this coming winter add to the gloomy global economic outlook. These conditions would be problematic for property markets: slowing or falling economic growth dampens tenant demand, while higher interest rates raise the cost of developing or acquiring properties. Both factors would cut returns and reduce values.

The differential prospects for real estate cash flows are the subject of the next section. G LO BA L 2 The path of fundamentals will ultimately help determine where values settle Early in 2022, we framed the impact of rising inflation and interest rates on values as a race between debt costs and net operating income growth, as we anticipated that higher inflation would translate into higher rents in some sectors. Currently, it seems that debt costs are mostly winning the race. Ultimately, however, valuations are the result of the interaction between higher debt costs and the path of real estate fundamentals, the prospects for which vary widely across sectors and geographies.

Investors should receive similar ex ante returns for similar risks, or else any free lunches will be arbitraged away. In practice, private market real estate pricing tends to be impacted by broader capital market shifts mainly when there are changes in the cost of real estate debt, since the marginal buyer of income-producing real estate is most often a leveraged buyer. When debt costs rise, the market thins before price pressures are reflected in transactions. This tends to create a time lag between higher interest rates and declines in private equity real estate pricing. In most markets globally, we are now feeling the impact of more expensive real estate debt, which in many cases is no longer accretive to returns at current private market valuations. The math of debt costs and going-in yields is relentless. When the yield starting point is especially low in absolute terms, modest increases in debt costs and yields as measured in basis points mathematically translate into big percentage changes in capital values.", "filename": "isa-outlook-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " Says the regional leader of one global firm, Cap rates have gapped out as interest rates went up.

As the partner in one lead- ing advisory firm explains, This is one of those cash is king situations where borrowing costs are higher, and if youre an all- cash buyer, those probably represent a disproportionate share of the people in the market today. Meanwhile, the same interest rate increases that reduce lever- aged returns and thus demand for real estate also make bonds and other interest-bearing investments more compelling. As the head of real estate banking at one investment bank explains, Rising bond yields are going to mean that real estate and other alternatives are all going to be facing less availability of capital and some outflows. And while interest rates are increasing, equity and bond prices have been falling, triggering the denominator effect for some institutional investors with asset allocations that must remain in balance.

We are reluctant to make investment decisions based solely on a view of future interest rates, but acknowledge that real estate pricing is linked to future interest rates. Given this dynamic, we recommend investors consider a range of interest rate scenarios . Interest rate increases and the relentless math Each time interest rates ticked higher since the GFC, the question of when higher debt costs would impact real estate values was asked. It was a speculative question, with the underlying assumption that rate increases thus far had not yet impacted values. Regardless of the answer then, it became very clear in 2022 that the relentless math of higher borrowing rates was having an impact on leveraged returns and asset values . The boost investors were getting from borrowing has shifted to a drag on a cash basis, but with unleveraged internal rates of return generally above borrowing rates, leverage is still marginally accretive on a total return basis. However, with less lift from borrowing, leveraged buyers are largely out of the market . Higher borrowing rates are a function of both higher indices and increased borrowing spreads. Lending volume is down significantly and lenders are becoming more conservative. The supply of debt capital from large money center banks is down due to large positions taken in the first half of 2022 coupled with stress testing.", "filename": "isa-outlook-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " As such, evidence of the most significant repricing to date has been concentrated in the lowest- yielding sectors, where transactions have held up most. This has surprised some observers since these low-yielding property types are mostly the winning sectors of recent years and they continue to possess attractive growth profiles. That some of the largest recent value declines may be occurring in the most sought- after property types, such as logistics and residential, might come as a shock after years of banner outperformance, especially during the pandemic. Even so, these property types remain the strongest performers over longer trailing periods and values have also fallen in the less favored sectors, although such adjustments are masked by lower price transparency in these property types. This repricing has been labeled mechanical by some because it is a function of exogenous debt assumptions increasing in investors spreadsheets. An alternative way to look at it is that it is mechanical because debt pricing is a mechanism by which real estate is linked to the broader capital markets, through lenders cost of funds. Another such mechanism is the denominator effect. This involves comparing real-time values from public markets to lagging valuation-based assessments of private market portfolios, causing some investors to conclude that they are suddenly overweight in the unlisted assets compared to their target allocation. Either way, the downward direction of the pricing pressure is clear and it will likely persist as long as the all-in cost of debt is dilutive to leveraged returns.

In addition, lenders may become more averse to lodging assets in drive-to leisure destinations and more enthusiastic about assets in traditional gateway markets, if group and individual business travel continues to increase. Borrowers with a proven track record in hotel investment, as well as strong lender relationships, will have a competitive edge. The impacts of climate change are becoming increasingly more apparent with the increased rate of natural disasters, flooding, and abnormal weather patterns.

Government policy also matters. As central banks seek to choke off inflation by tightening monetary policy, there is at least the reasonable expectation that some of that inflation will be passed into rents and thus property cash flows. But when governments employ long-term borrowing to bail out energy consumers in the short term, as is necessary in Europe, interest rates are pushed up further and the impact on property values may be more detrimental.

Pressures for greater ESG disclosure by real estate owners and investors are intensifying due to efforts both from indus- try groups like NCREIF and PREA and from government regulation by the SEC.  As shelter costs increasingly strain household budgets, state and local governments are resorting to regulation to address affordability, including various types of rent control and vacancy taxes.  While building owners and developers benefit from various government incentives, the industry faces an increasingly challenging set of environmental and economic regulations. Will certain regulations end up being counterproductive? Preceding trends highlighted several areas where private markets have been slow to fix mounting problems that the property sector has played a central role in creating, notably climate change and housing affordability. Industry groups are calling for collective voluntary action, which is a start.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " But even then it would still take years to reduce the accumulated surplus demand. In the short term, therefore, policymakers could further tighten rent regulation to at least alleviate the symptoms of the housing shortage. For example, at the end of November Hamburg proposed legislation to introduce a cap on index-linked rents. Because more landlords are currently relying on such index-linked rents, we believe that their tighter regulation is a scenario that landlords should prepare for. As stronger regulation acts as a barrier to market entry, such and similar regulatory interventions reinforce the defensive investment character of residential real estate. They cap the potential for rental growth, but precisely because of this they have the effect of tightening supply and thus ensure very secure and stable returns. For risk-averse investors, the market thus remains attractive in principle. Against the backdrop of the climate targets for the German building stock, which have so far been missed by a wide margin, regulatory pressure could also increase here. A range of measures is conceivable, from renovation incentives to usage bans, as already exists in other European countries. These no longer only affect the income side, but also the cost side and thus represent a completely different kind of risk.

The volume of new housing developments is also falling due to increasingly stringent environmental rules, shortages of materials and rising labour costs. Demand continues to outstrip supply, especially in the affordable segment. If the number of new-build projects continues to decline, the valuations of existing stock may hold up relatively well. Increases in mortgage rates mean home ownership will move out of reach of a growing group of people, forcing them to turn to the rental market for accommodation that fits their budgets. Residential real estate is seen as a relatively good inflation hedge as most rental contracts are index-linked but, in our view, it will not be possible to pass on the full level of consumer price rises to tenants.

But investors can still develop an edge by identifying the best markets and strategies within sectors. There are a wide range of metro areas in North America for an investor to sort through to identify the best targets and there is no shortcut around doing the work to identify the best-positioned markets. The rent growth outlook, in combination with pricing and market risk factors, remain paramount in this selection process.

The logistics market and the less regulated part of the residential market might be an exception. But here, too, the uncertainty about further developments is likely to be too great, at least temporarily. Another relevant lower edge for property yields is financing costs. At the end of the third quarter of 2022, prime yields in all major market segments were below the cost of debt capital . This situation could only persist if the number of equity buyers is sufficiently large. Indeed, such investors are currently quite active and are taking advantage of the lower prices for purchases. However, we think it unlikely that the existing equity volume will be sufficient to anchor prices below the cost of financing. The fact that the increase in initial yields is nevertheless likely to be comparatively flat is also due to the mostly comfortable financing situation on the part of the landlords. Apart from the project development segment, we expect few forced sales. We rule out a wave of non-performing loans like after the financial crisis. Nevertheless, the steep rise in interest rates is likely to put individual landlords under stress, especially in the value-add and opportunistic segments, where financing durations are typically short. Lower demand for space and rents due to the recession could jeopardise the implementation of the business plan and thus also refinancing.", "filename": "outlook-real-estatet-market-germany-dec-2022.pdf"}, {"text": " around long-term interest rates and pricing than around near-term economic growth and real estate fundamentals. We are reluctant to make investment decisions based solely on a view of future interest rates, but acknowledge that real estate pricing is linked to future interest rates. Given this dynamic, we recommend investors consider a range of interest rate scenarios . Interest rate increases and the relentless math Each time interest rates ticked higher since the GFC, the question of when higher debt costs would impact real estate values was asked. It was a speculative question, with the underlying assumption that rate increases thus far had not yet impacted values. Regardless of the answer then, it became very clear in 2022 that the relentless math of higher borrowing rates was having an impact on leveraged returns and asset values . The boost investors were getting from borrowing has shifted to a drag on a cash basis, but with unleveraged internal rates of return generally above borrowing rates, leverage is still marginally accretive on a total return basis. However, with less lift from borrowing, leveraged buyers are largely out of the market . Higher borrowing rates are a function of both higher indices and increased borrowing spreads. Lending volume is down significantly and lenders are becoming more conservative. The supply of debt capital from large money center banks is down due to large positions taken in the first half of 2022 coupled with stress testing.", "filename": "isa-outlook-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " Secondly, in an environment of rising interest rates, lenders can use the equity released from repaid loans to grant new, higher-interest loans. In this respect, it could be that lenders in many cases are aiming for a speedy redemption of loans. In addition to refinancing issues, there are other reasons for an increasing number of sales. For example, the devaluation of equities and bonds may have led to real estate quotas above target in some portfolios. This could trigger sales. Liquidity bottlenecks in open-end funds due to cash outflows could also make sales necessary. Against this backdrop and based on our observation that the number of sales processes started has already risen in recent weeks, we expect more supply again in perspective than recently. The big unknown is how much demand this supply will be matched by. In principle, many investment managers and other capital collection agencies still have plenty of money to invest, and capital sources such as insurance companies and pension institutions are continuously receiving more money to invest. However, the trend in recent years of more and more of this money flowing into the real estate markets may have been broken with the turnaround in interest rates. The artificially low interest rates have made the money and bond market unattractive for many years. In addition, central banks have squeezed private investors out of the market with their securities purchase programmes and forced them to invest their money elsewhere, including in real estate.", "filename": "outlook-real-estatet-market-germany-dec-2022.pdf"}, {"text": " This is because market participants must assess what prices should be, made more challenging by uncertainty over the future path of the economy. Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs. We have already started to see cap rates and yields rise in many markets, with the most rapid adjustment taking place in the UK. However, we do not think that prices fully reflect higher interest rates yet. To assess when values might bottom out, we can look to past downturns and the listed market for guidance. In the Global Financial Crisis, for example, global capital values bottomed out in 4Q09, while GDP across global real estate markets troughed three quarters earlier, in 1Q09, as did global listed real estate prices1. Market downturns usually present opportunities, and one we expect for investors in 2023 is a correction in pricing as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. Although we do not expect large amounts of distress in the market, we do expect some, already apparent in parts of the UK market. This should allow investors access to assets at attractive pricing. The early 1990s downturn was longer, with US capital values continuing to decline into 1995.

Discussions with numerous participants from all corners of the industry confirm that many investors have moved to the sidelinesor to other types of assets like equities and bonds. Indeed, the recent surge may well reflect a last gasp to get deals done before the expected increase in interest rates. Fewer Investors Fewer investors and lenders will be providing capital for assets, according to this years Emerging Trends survey: expectations of availability declined for every one of the 13 equity and debt capital sources. Over the past decade, CRE markets benefited from a substantial capital inflow as alternative investment classes have gained wider acceptance and real estate offered compel- ling risk-adjusted returns. Now, some of those inflows look to reverse. Investor interest is still healthy, but not what it was. Instead of seven or 10 competing offers for sale, theres now two or three, which I think thats normal, says the head of an investment firm. Thats normalizing, too.

And suddenly, things didnt pencil, and that generated broken deals. The cost of financing for real estate and everything else went up dramatically.

Also limiting investor demand: debt is getting more difficult to obtain, and the Emerging Trends survey expects underwriting standards to get even more rigorous. As the partner in one lead- ing advisory firm explains, This is one of those cash is king situations where borrowing costs are higher, and if youre an all- cash buyer, those probably represent a disproportionate share of the people in the market today. Meanwhile, the same interest rate increases that reduce lever- aged returns and thus demand for real estate also make bonds and other interest-bearing investments more compelling. As the head of real estate banking at one investment bank explains, Rising bond yields are going to mean that real estate and other alternatives are all going to be facing less availability of capital and some outflows. And while interest rates are increasing, equity and bond prices have been falling, triggering the denominator effect for some institutional investors with asset allocations that must remain in balance. The denominator effect can be magnified because CRE values in a portfolio are generally appraisal-based, which tend to be backward-looking.

Market update and assessment of rental and investment markets 20222023 Ulrich Hller on the big picture of 2022: In 2022, the German commercial real estate market was defined by four central developments that put an end to the long- standing and unbroken economic upswing: firstly, there was the interest rate turnaround that brought significantly increasing financing costs. Secondly, the highest levels of inflation in decades, with very high energy prices and costs of materials, led to a considerable increase in building costs. However, due to the high number of halted projects and the corresponding drop in demand, there are already signs of improvement here. Thirdly, there was a glaring shortage of skilled workers, and finally the new reticence of many domestic and foreign investors, for whom Germany has temporarily lost its attractiveness. As a result, the German real estate market has slowed markedly: the number of requested and granted building permits decreased by almost 10 per cent.

This is bad news for city centre retail in two respects, with the need to make savings driving consumer spending down further. Nominal wages are rising comparatively strongly in 2022, however the growth is being more than offset by high inflation, probably of an annual average rate close to 8 per cent. Below the line, spending power is falling significantly, much more steeply than in the last three decades. While low inflation has supported retail activity since 2012 in the form of real wage growth, the opposite is now the case. Busy shopping centres and restaurants convey a different picture.

But can the Federal Reserve Bank tame inflation without breaking the economy? Moderating inflation rates this summer led many to believe that the worst was over and that the Fed could soon ease up its con- tractionary monetary policy. Indeed, the consensus of experts we interviewed this summer was that the Fed would cease tightening by the end of 2022 and start cutting rates again in mid-2023. That sentiment now appears optimistic. Inflation is going to be a little stickier than people think, said an investment banking executive we interviewed during the summer, whose views turned out to be more prescient. Sentiment started changing in late August when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell gave his annual speech to fellow central bankers affirming the Fed view that infla- tion is not nearly under control, jolting markets.

Among them is one rule that may seem puzzling at first: The district must mingle build- ings that vary in age and condition, including a good proportion of old ones. Why the need for old buildings? Why not all new? If a city area has only new buildings, the enterprises that can exist there are automatically limited to those that can support the high costs of new construction.

In an August 2022 survey by the National Association of Business Economics, only a quarter of economists were even somewhat confident that the Fed could bring down inflation to its target range without causing a recession. Worrying signs out of Europe in early autumn and expectations of soaring heating bills this coming winter add to the gloomy global economic outlook. These conditions would be problematic for property markets: slowing or falling economic growth dampens tenant demand, while higher interest rates raise the cost of developing or acquiring properties.

Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs. We have already started to see cap rates and yields rise in many markets, with the most rapid adjustment taking place in the UK. However, we do not think that prices fully reflect higher interest rates yet. To assess when values might bottom out, we can look to past downturns and the listed market for guidance. In the Global Financial Crisis, for example, global capital values bottomed out in 4Q09, while GDP across global real estate markets troughed three quarters earlier, in 1Q09, as did global listed real estate prices1. Market downturns usually present opportunities, and one we expect for investors in 2023 is a correction in pricing as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. Although we do not expect large amounts of distress in the market, we do expect some, already apparent in parts of the UK market. This should allow investors access to assets at attractive pricing. The early 1990s downturn was longer, with US capital values continuing to decline into 1995.

The following consequences are likely to result from an environment with structurally high inflation, a tendency toward somewhat higher nominal interest rates and negative real interest rates. First, prices will probably remain under pressure until the end of the interest rate hikes. Second, highly leveraged projects are significantly riskier than in the past decade, which should put the brakes on risk-taking investors. This scenario would therefore continue to allow risk-averse, long-term investors to achieve decent returns. 4.5 Risk scenario for 2023 and later: Structurally high inflation There are two main reasons why inflation could continue to spike upward. First, tax revenues bubble up when inflation rates are high. This allows for a very loose fiscal policy and boosts inflation, again. Second, a labor market in full employment and an acute shortage of labor and skilled workers raises wages. This is particularly true due to the impending wave of retirements, which is likely to increase demand for workers. Strong interest rate hikes increase the risk of recession and the risks to financial market stability. Therefore, central banks may tend to raise interest rates only tentatively. However, the history from the 1970s and the interest rate shock in the early 1980s teaches us that when inflation is structurally high, these risks are eventually accepted in order to bring inflation back under control.

But can the Federal Reserve Bank tame inflation without breaking the economy? Moderating inflation rates this summer led many to believe that the worst was over and that the Fed could soon ease up its con- tractionary monetary policy. Indeed, the consensus of experts we interviewed this summer was that the Fed would cease tightening by the end of 2022 and start cutting rates again in mid-2023. That sentiment now appears optimistic. Inflation is going to be a little stickier than people think, said an investment banking executive we interviewed during the summer, whose views turned out to be more prescient. Sentiment started changing in late August when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell gave his annual speech to fellow central bankers affirming the Fed view that infla- tion is not nearly under control, jolting markets.

Interest rate increases and the relentless math Each time interest rates ticked higher since the GFC, the question of when higher debt costs would impact real estate values was asked. It was a speculative question, with the underlying assumption that rate increases thus far had not yet impacted values. Regardless of the answer then, it became very clear in 2022 that the relentless math of higher borrowing rates was having an impact on leveraged returns and asset values . The boost investors were getting from borrowing has shifted to a drag on a cash basis, but with unleveraged internal rates of return generally above borrowing rates, leverage is still marginally accretive on a total return basis. However, with less lift from borrowing, leveraged buyers are largely out of the market . Higher borrowing rates are a function of both higher indices and increased borrowing spreads.

In sum, capital availability should decline in the near term, though the denominator effect may not force sales as much as in typical downturns. Uncertainty Hesitancy Perhaps the biggest headwind to getting deals done now is uncertainty over where prices will settle. Reflecting the views of many experts we interviewed, one senior investment banker says, Transactions are being done at cap rates that are anywhere from 25 to 75 basis points wider than they werebut there is not any conviction that these are the right levels. That translates into a 5 to 15 percent drop in values so far, with more to come. But there are too few assets trading now to know for sure. Buyers are concerned about overpaying.

In this respect, it could be that lenders in many cases are aiming for a speedy redemption of loans. In addition to refinancing issues, there are other reasons for an increasing number of sales. For example, the devaluation of equities and bonds may have led to real estate quotas above target in some portfolios. This could trigger sales. Liquidity bottlenecks in open-end funds due to cash outflows could also make sales necessary. Against this backdrop and based on our observation that the number of sales processes started has already risen in recent weeks, we expect more supply again in perspective than recently. The big unknown is how much demand this supply will be matched by. In principle, many investment managers and other capital collection agencies still have plenty of money to invest, and capital sources such as insurance companies and pension institutions are continuously receiving more money to invest. However, the trend in recent years of more and more of this money flowing into the real estate markets may have been broken with the turnaround in interest rates. The artificially low interest rates have made the money and bond market unattractive for many years.

Meanwhile, the same interest rate increases that reduce lever- aged returns and thus demand for real estate also make bonds and other interest-bearing investments more compelling. As the head of real estate banking at one investment bank explains, Rising bond yields are going to mean that real estate and other alternatives are all going to be facing less availability of capital and some outflows. And while interest rates are increasing, equity and bond prices have been falling, triggering the denominator effect for some institutional investors with asset allocations that must remain in balance.

This has surprised some observers since these low-yielding property types are mostly the winning sectors of recent years and they continue to possess attractive growth profiles. That some of the largest recent value declines may be occurring in the most sought- after property types, such as logistics and residential, might come as a shock after years of banner outperformance, especially during the pandemic. Even so, these property types remain the strongest performers over longer trailing periods and values have also fallen in the less favored sectors, although such adjustments are masked by lower price transparency in these property types. This repricing has been labeled mechanical by some because it is a function of exogenous debt assumptions increasing in investors spreadsheets. An alternative way to look at it is that it is mechanical because debt pricing is a mechanism by which real estate is linked to the broader capital markets, through lenders cost of funds. Another such mechanism is the denominator effect. This involves comparing real-time values from public markets to lagging valuation-based assessments of private market portfolios, causing some investors to conclude that they are suddenly overweight in the unlisted assets compared to their target allocation. Either way, the downward direction of the pricing pressure is clear and it will likely persist as long as the all-in cost of debt is dilutive to leveraged returns.

Investors should receive similar ex ante returns for similar risks, or else any free lunches will be arbitraged away. In practice, private market real estate pricing tends to be impacted by broader capital market shifts mainly when there are changes in the cost of real estate debt, since the marginal buyer of income-producing real estate is most often a leveraged buyer. When debt costs rise, the market thins before price pressures are reflected in transactions. This tends to create a time lag between higher interest rates and declines in private equity real estate pricing. In most markets globally, we are now feeling the impact of more expensive real estate debt, which in many cases is no longer accretive to returns at current private market valuations. The math of debt costs and going-in yields is relentless.

This situation could only persist if the number of equity buyers is sufficiently large. Indeed, such investors are currently quite active and are taking advantage of the lower prices for purchases. However, we think it unlikely that the existing equity volume will be sufficient to anchor prices below the cost of financing. The fact that the increase in initial yields is nevertheless likely to be comparatively flat is also due to the mostly comfortable financing situation on the part of the landlords. Apart from the project development segment, we expect few forced sales. We rule out a wave of non-performing loans like after the financial crisis. Nevertheless, the steep rise in interest rates is likely to put individual landlords under stress, especially in the value-add and opportunistic segments, where financing durations are typically short.

This prompted central banks to make aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022, with more expected in 2023, along with a mild recession in the economy. Looking back to our 2022 predictions, in general they proved prescient. We expected hybrid working to weigh on the office market and that the polarization between the best and worst assets would continue, which has been the case. We expected retail capital values to bottom out, which they had started to, but are now likely to be impacted by weakening consumer spending. We said that property investors would no longer be able to rely on market-driven yield compression to drive returns, which has certainly proved accurate as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. In 2023, the environment for real estate looks set to be more challenging, with headwinds coming both from higher interest rates and a weaker economy, which will impact on occupier demand.

But until that occurs, properties will be offered on the hope that aspirational pricing targets anchored on peak levels will be achieved and a bid-ask gap will persist. Our expectation is that transaction activity will be below average in 2023, but start to recover in some sectors later in the year. While unleveraged buyers are not directly impacted by higher interest rates, they are also shifting their pricing and buying activity. They are adjusting their cost of capital in response to the broader capital markets, and unleveraged or low-leverage buyers are capital constrained as well. Higher interest rates have hurt the value of investors broader investment portfolios, triggering the so-called denominator effect, contributing to less competitive and less aggressive pricing for real estate. Private real estate pricing will adjust most quickly to the reality of higher interest rates in the sectors with the greatest investor interest . The price discovery process will be much slower for sectors already seeing fewer transactions, such as offices.

Successful real estate investing rests on identification of timeless attributes that are successful over the course of several cycles.

We expect office demand to recover slowly, as obsolete buildings are removed due to conversion of use or demolition. Fundamentals and rents will eventually recover, but that is likely years away. Healthy fundamentals sustain many sectors through economic weakness The sector chasm referenced in the global chapter has produced a variety of winners in the North American market. These include industrial and apartments and in the US, single-family rental and self-storage. These sectors are still experiencing the same interest rate math that is driving up borrowing rates, raising required returns and resulting in lower transaction prices. However, despite the negative near-term economic outlook, we still expect these sectors to generate positive rent growth in 2023 and beyond. To be clear, our view is that rent growth will be closer to long-term averages than during the inflation-fueled spike of 2021 and 2022. But vacancy rates in these sectors are still well below long-term averages, giving a cushion before pricing power shifts towards tenants .

We have already started to see cap rates and yields rise in many markets, with the most rapid adjustment taking place in the UK. However, we do not think that prices fully reflect higher interest rates yet. To assess when values might bottom out, we can look to past downturns and the listed market for guidance. In the Global Financial Crisis, for example, global capital values bottomed out in 4Q09, while GDP across global real estate markets troughed three quarters earlier, in 1Q09, as did global listed real estate prices1. Market downturns usually present opportunities, and one we expect for investors in 2023 is a correction in pricing as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. Although we do not expect large amounts of distress in the market, we do expect some, already apparent in parts of the UK market. This should allow investors access to assets at attractive pricing.

Demographics and the slowing economy could also help ease the housing imbalance. The nations population is growing at its slowest pace ever, thanks to both low birth and immigration rates. And fewer buyers are on the hunt for homes now due to affordability and concerns about possible job losses in a recession. The good news is that it is an opportunity for home- builders and land developers to do a little catch-up. Theyve been running behind for two years, and they may actually welcome a little respite to finish the homes that they have sold, thinks a senior adviser to many homebuilders. But these favorable trends alone will not be nearly enough to solve the affordability quandary. What else would help?

Just as Henry Ford slashed the time needed to build a Model T from 12 hours to 96 min- utes through process improvements, the same innovations and improvements should be focused on housing.

Even if affordability eventually improves with falling housing prices, the reality is that the key issue underpinning the crisis is insufficient sup- ply to meet high demand for all types of homes. Demand will continue to rise, especially as the Canadian government com- mits to higher immigration targets in the coming years and the country welcomes large numbers of temporary residents, like international students, who also need places to live. This means that even as homebuilding activity has been rising, tight market conditions have put pressures on affordability that are unlikely to ease significantly.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " But higher interest rates will counteract the affordability impacts of any easing of home prices, at least for the time being. And overall affordability pressures are affecting other classes of residential real estate as rising interest rates and the resulting challenges faced by homebuyers in qualifying for financing under the mortgage stress test push many potential purchasers to try to rent a home instead. But with supply also constrained and getting even tighter in the rental market, rising rents are adding to the growing affordability crisis. While the RBCs report noted that worsening affordability condi- tions would be particularly marked in relatively high-priced markets like Toronto and Vancouver, the challenges have been spreading across Canada as Canadians increasingly move to other communitieslike suburbs and evolving 18-hour cities as well as small towns and rural areasin search of cheaper places to live. Migration away from Canadas largest cities which still tend to see population increases as a result of high rates of international immigrationhas been a trend for some time, but the growth of remote working during the pandemic has exacerbated the move outwards and helped make affordability pressures more widespread. We can see the impacts in annual population estimates published earlier in 2022 from Statistics Canada. The findings, which cover annual population changes as of July 1, 2021, include the following:  Toronto and Montreal saw the largest net migration losses to other regions of Ontario and Quebec, respectively, since at least 20012002.  Net intraprovincial migration to rural areas increased across Canada.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " The residential sector as a whole is a beneficiary of the ongoing trend of urbanisation in major cities across Europe. Wealth tends to be concentrated in larger urban centres with better employment opportunities where the average age of the working population is lower than in regional and more remote communities. Demand for living assets remains strong in most urbanised areas due to demographic growth and the rising number of households, boosted by immigration and the expanding number of younger and older people living alone. The volume of new housing developments is also falling due to increasingly stringent environmental rules, shortages of materials and rising labour costs. Demand continues to outstrip supply, especially in the affordable segment. If the number of new-build projects continues to decline, the valuations of existing stock may hold up relatively well. Increases in mortgage rates mean home ownership will move out of reach of a growing group of people, forcing them to turn to the rental market for accommodation that fits their budgets. Residential real estate is seen as a relatively good inflation hedge as most rental contracts are index-linked but, in our view, it will not be possible to pass on the full level of consumer price rises to tenants. Governments in many countries are implementing measures to offset energy price hikes or cap rental increases to support the purchasing power of people living in social housing and other low- to middle-income tenants.

Trends triggered by the Covid pandemic, such as working from home (WFH), and the boom in online shopping, continue to have an impact. Added to these are the economic impact and uncertainty following Russias invasion of Ukraine. The real estate sector is facing a skills shortage, supply chain problems and rapidly rising costs for new construction and renovation. Rising capital market yields are driving up property financing costs and the returns expected by real estate investors. The ECB also contribu- ted to this with two strong key interest rate increases in July and September 2022.  This is not making decisions to invest in the real estate market any easier, alt- hough with initial rental yields clearly outperforming bond yields, property remains an interesting class.

Current trends and developments Ulrich Hller on the shortage of skilled workers: The shortage of skilled workers has turned into a serious business risk in the construction industry as well. At the beginning of 2022, in a survey by the Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry , 78 per cent of construction companies identified the shortage of skilled workers as the main risk to their own economic development. In 2010, by contrast, it was only 21 per cent. Labour costs have always been very important in the personnel-intensive construction industry. Here, only changes in the legal framework can produce relief: Germany urgently needs an efficient and targeted immigration law that provides the economy with significantly more qualified and motivated workers who want to learn and prove themselves. Ulrich Hller on the ESG topic: The number one subject of discussion in 2021 was the implementation of ESG requirements. Even though it was pushed into the background in 2022, this will return to be the prevailing topic in the future. The issue of climate protection, decarbonisation and the required reduction of the CO2 footprint presents us with dramatically growing challenges around the globe.", "filename": "2022-12-12_ABG_Statements_Hoeller_2022-2023_en.pdf"}, {"text": "6 percent on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter of 2022. For nonresidential construction, cost increases were lower but still significant at 12.8 percent. Construction cost increases continued into the second quarter of 2022 amid inflationary pressures throughout the economy. Rising labor shortages are exacerbating the challenges. According to Statistics Canada, construction job vacancies reached a record high in the first quarter of 2022 and were double the number of open positions during the same period in 2020. And then there is the impact of construction wages, which were up 6.6 percent in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2021. All of this has made completing projects on time and on budget even harder than in the past, and the situation is unlikely to improve in the foreseeable future. The shortage of trades labor is not expected to get better any time soon and construction technologies have yet to evolve to make up the difference in cost or productivity. Adaptation Key as the Landscape Shifts for Canadian Real Estate What does this mean for real estate companies? For some, it adds further to the need to take a pause on activity. There have been rising projections, for example, of developers delaying or potentially canceling condo projects as it becomes harder to make the numbers work in these challenging conditions. Others are trying to manage this by spacing out advanced sales of new housing units to ensure that prices reflect rising costs as a project moves forward.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " Explains the director of an investment institute who developed housing earlier in his career, A lot of the homebuilders, when the Great Recession happened, were stuck with inventory, said, Were not doing that again.

The construction sector as a whole hasnt returned to the peak we saw prior to the Great Recession. We saw a lot of that labor leave the sector for something maybe perceived more stable, says the economist for a housing advisory firm. All these factors are conspiring to limit housing construction far below population growth. In fact, the number of single-family housing starts in the last decade (20102019) relative to house- hold formations was the lowest since the government began tracking these trends and half as much or less than in preced- ing decades, despite the consistent increase in deliveries since bottoming in 2010.

We have seen initiatives from higher levels of government to encourage faster development approvals by municipalities, new money to incentivize construction of affordable homes, and policy changes aimed at facilitating the building of modestly denser forms of housing, like duplexes, triplexes, and mid-rise buildings, in urban areas currently reserved for single-family units. While the increased acknowledgment of the supply gap is posi- tive and the initiatives in response are welcome, the actions fall have been taking on their own, with one describing efforts to make a small number of units more accessible by modifying deposit structures. One interviewee discussed their efforts to increase efficiencies by shifting certain engineering and construction activities to happen earlier in the design pro- cess. Another interviewee emphasized the need for more collaborative partnerships among industry players, nonprofit organizations, and governments to deliver affordable hous- ing. There are many examples of creative partnerships and approaches to building affordable homes in Canada that, with the right funding and incentives from governments, can make a difference if applied more broadly.

One factor con- tributing to the tight labor market is retirements by those older than the core-age cohort, and with Canadas population aging, we can expect these demographic trends to add to the chal- lenges experienced by sectors like the construction industry. So, what can we do about this? A key action is to heed calls in reports like the one from Ontarios housing affordability task force to change immigration criteria to prioritize skilled-trades workers.

In Japan, debt costs have moved far less than in other parts of the world, as inflation remains subdued and the Bank of Japan continues to exercise yield curve control . By contrast, Europes real estate yield starting point was exceptionally low and market interest rates have moved up much more markedly, making the math that much more impactful. Government policy also matters. As central banks seek to choke off inflation by tightening monetary policy, there is at least the reasonable expectation that some of that inflation will be passed into rents and thus property cash flows. But when governments employ long-term borrowing to bail out energy consumers in the short term, as is necessary in Europe, interest rates are pushed up further and the impact on property values may be more detrimental.

Investors should receive similar ex ante returns for similar risks, or else any free lunches will be arbitraged away. In practice, private market real estate pricing tends to be impacted by broader capital market shifts mainly when there are changes in the cost of real estate debt, since the marginal buyer of income-producing real estate is most often a leveraged buyer. When debt costs rise, the market thins before price pressures are reflected in transactions. This tends to create a time lag between higher interest rates and declines in private equity real estate pricing. In most markets globally, we are now feeling the impact of more expensive real estate debt, which in many cases is no longer accretive to returns at current private market valuations. The math of debt costs and going-in yields is relentless. When the yield starting point is especially low in absolute terms, modest increases in debt costs and yields as measured in basis points mathematically translate into big percentage changes in capital values.", "filename": "isa-outlook-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " Given the high debt levels in many euro countries, they are likely to remain structurally low, probably negative. In this case, borrowers can let inflation work for them, which means they have to pay back less purchasing power than they have borrowed. Another factor is inflation protection. In periods of high inflation, house and apartment prices increased faster than inflation. This is likely to be the case this time as well, especially against the backdrop of the high supply shortage. Last but not least, rents are starting to pick up. Admittedly, the strict regulatory environment argues against strong rent increases. But the increase in short-term rentals, furnished rentals and the likely strong rise in the share of index rents point to higher rent growth. The relative risk position also makes the German housing market attractive. For example, although prices are currently falling, the declines are small compared with the stock and bond markets. Since house and apartment prices historically rise with inflation, the residential real estate market should also be more attractive for institutional investors in the long term than the bond market, which may yield a higher cash flow but generally does not offer inflation protection. Furthermore, the residential real estate market is again likely to be significantly less cyclical and dependent on rate changes than the commercial real estate market.

UBS Asset Management Weve narrowed it down to A year ago, the world remained in the grips of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Omicron variant had just emerged. 12 months on and the pandemic has largely subsided, only to be replaced by a brutal war in Ukraine and inflation reaching multi-decade highs. This prompted central banks to make aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022, with more expected in 2023, along with a mild recession in the economy. Looking back to our 2022 predictions, in general they proved prescient. We expected hybrid working to weigh on the office market and that the polarization between the best and worst assets would continue, which has been the case. We expected retail capital values to bottom out, which they had started to, but are now likely to be impacted by weakening consumer spending. We said that property investors would no longer be able to rely on market-driven yield compression to drive returns, which has certainly proved accurate as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. In 2023, the environment for real estate looks set to be more challenging, with headwinds coming both from higher interest rates and a weaker economy, which will impact on occupier demand.

Results from the Emerging Trends survey echo this sentiment, with respondents placing industrial distribution at the top of the list for investment prospects for four of the last five years.

Office: Desperately Seeking Clarity about Its Future Into the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic, we should have clarity about the direction of the future workplace. However, what replaces the daily office grind remains murky and will not be resolved soon. Most companies are still experimenting to determine what works best for them in relation to what employ- ees are willing to do.

In our main scenario, we therefore also assume slightly falling prime rents for the coming year. In 2024, too, the downside risk outweighs the growth opportunities for rents in view of further rising vacancy rates. This could change from 2025 onwards, because the current environment of high financing and construction costs will lead to significantly fewer project developments being started. There could then be a lack of new construction space, at least, and this could lead to rising rents in the prime segment. Logistics markets Private households and the manufacturing sector are suffering particularly from the current and foreseeable macroeconomic environment. The former are facing a massive real loss of purchasing power due to high inflation and will have to reduce their consumption. The latter will be squeezed by rising energy costs and lower global demand. If fewer goods are bought as well as produced, this puts a double burden on the demand for logistics space. After rising to record levels until recently, take-up is expected to fall in 2023. A rising number of insolvencies, especially among small and medium-sized enterprises, could also lead to higher vacancy rates in the small-space segment.

We expect this latter trend to continue in the coming years, with Germany and France currently showing the most resistance to new greenfield developments.

The logistics market and the less regulated part of the residential market might be an exception. But here, too, the uncertainty about further developments is likely to be too great, at least temporarily. Another relevant lower edge for property yields is financing costs. At the end of the third quarter of 2022, prime yields in all major market segments were below the cost of debt capital . This situation could only persist if the number of equity buyers is sufficiently large. Indeed, such investors are currently quite active and are taking advantage of the lower prices for purchases. However, we think it unlikely that the existing equity volume will be sufficient to anchor prices below the cost of financing. The fact that the increase in initial yields is nevertheless likely to be comparatively flat is also due to the mostly comfortable financing situation on the part of the landlords. Apart from the project development segment, we expect few forced sales. We rule out a wave of non-performing loans like after the financial crisis. Nevertheless, the steep rise in interest rates is likely to put individual landlords under stress, especially in the value-add and opportunistic segments, where financing durations are typically short.

From the landlords point of view, the fundamental framework conditions not only remain favourable, the outlook has even improved compared to last year. However, the socially explosive nature of these developments is likely to call government onto the scene. Recently, it was decided to increase the linear depreciation from 2 to 3.

The Future of Single-Family Housing The early 2020s have been a transformative time for the housing industry as the pandemic caused people around the world to reevaluate both where they live and how they live. The United States experienced the Great American Move in which house- holds and businesses relocated to more affordable places, often to buy or rent a home with additional space and a yard, and farther from employment centers. Builders across the country could not keep up with the new demandand supply chain interruptions, labor shortages, and permitting delays during the COVID-19 pandemic did not help matters. As a result, home prices escalated at historic rates. The median new home price in the United States increased 22 percent since the start of 2020 and existing home prices increased 58 percent. 45 Today, the single-family housing industry is on the other side of the rapid run-up in demand and pricesinflation and the rapid escalation of mortgage rates have resulted in a cooldown of the for-sale housing market.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " 36 growth spiraled upward nationally in ranges from just under 10 percent to just shy of 25 percent.

Two, demand gathered speed and sweep as people sought larger living spaces to balance remote work and household life, and more outdoor living options.  Three, constrained construction of new supply, and a price run-up on the single-family for-sale front, spilled over into expanded apartment demand.  Lastly, compounding the effects of these four dramatic imbalances came the rocket fuel of a global capital rotation toward de-risked assets .

The con- verted Sport-Scheck will open at the beginning of the autumn as a pilot branch with a completely new concept over four floors. The Schlossgartenquartier group of buil- dings at the entrance to the Knigstrae will also be revitalised by 2025.

However, trade fair business could remain weak for a more prolonged period, partly due to the loss of the IAA auto show to the Munich trade fair. Frankfurt is a strong retail location with its two prime locations Zeil and Goethestrae as well as several large shopping centres. Another plus point is the fairly moderate decline in prime rents given the negative conditions. By the end of 2021 they had fallen by around 8 per cent to EUR 275 per m2 and have since remained unchanged. Plans for the City of Frankfurt to play an active role in the development of the city centre - some of which is not very attractive - are also positive. A total of EUR 30m is to be invested in city centre projects, with the aim of upgrading the quality of stay. How- ever, retail is also playing a role here. For example, the Galeria store at the entrance to the Zeil has been remodelled into the Weltstadthaus and has been visibly upgraded while remaining open. The former sports arena building which is also close to the Hauptwache is being demolished and will be replaced by 2024 by a modern commercial building with offices.

Walk around the bustling old port districts of Montreal or Boston or Portland, Maine, and you will find hundreds of for- mer warehouses that have been repurposed into upscale hotels, cool offices, hip restaurants, and distinctive retail spaces. Conversions are hardly limited to old warehouse districts. Every vibrant downtown is filled with buildings of varying types and vintages that have been converted into new uses. Often the conversions go upstream, as lower-value land uses like ware- houses convert into higher-value uses like office or retail. But the direction is often reversed, with old offices converting into artist space or storage.

But manythough not allof these can be either repurposed or upgraded to meet new market standards. The many opportunities include the following: 18  Converting older offices to residential uses, or upgrading them into modern offices, where feasible and supported by the market.

The demand for rental housing has by no means weakened, as seemed to be foreseeable at the beginning of the year. Due to the influx of Ukrainian refugees, Germanys population has risen to over 84 million people for the first time. In addition, current population forecasts, such as the one by Deutsche Bank, assume a high immigration rate in the future and thus a continued increase in demand for housing. Due to the sharp rise in financing costs, many households can no longer afford to buy their own home and remain tenants.

This is reflected in consumer sentiment which has fallen to a historic low. The GfK survey shows that income expectations have slumped to an even greater degree than the propensity to buy. This is bad news for city centre retail in two respects, with the need to make savings driving consumer spending down further. Nominal wages are rising comparatively strongly in 2022, however the growth is being more than offset by high inflation, probably of an annual average rate close to 8 per cent. Below the line, spending power is falling significantly, much more steeply than in the last three decades. While low inflation has supported retail activity since 2012 in the form of real wage growth, the opposite is now the case. Busy shopping centres and restaurants convey a different picture.

Both also enter 2023 with economies that are still growing and real estate fundamentals largely in balance. There are challenges, but the medium- to long-term outlook remains brighter than the outlook for the near-term. Real estate investors need strategies that are resilient to an expected volatile environment in 2023 and take advantage of the opportunities emerging from volatility. Stubbornly high inflation The root cause of market challenges heading into 2023 is elevated inflation. The US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada have both made lowering inflation their top priority, but it remains stubbornly high in both markets. This led to policy rates increasing from effectively zero to over four percent by year end. The increase in policy rates has been mirrored in long-term rates and in real estate borrowing rates.

Current trends and developments Ulrich Hller on the shortage of skilled workers: The shortage of skilled workers has turned into a serious business risk in the construction industry as well. At the beginning of 2022, in a survey by the Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry , 78 per cent of construction companies identified the shortage of skilled workers as the main risk to their own economic development. In 2010, by contrast, it was only 21 per cent. Labour costs have always been very important in the personnel-intensive construction industry. Here, only changes in the legal framework can produce relief: Germany urgently needs an efficient and targeted immigration law that provides the economy with significantly more qualified and motivated workers who want to learn and prove themselves. Ulrich Hller on the ESG topic: The number one subject of discussion in 2021 was the implementation of ESG requirements. Even though it was pushed into the background in 2022, this will return to be the prevailing topic in the future. The issue of climate protection, decarbonisation and the required reduction of the CO2 footprint presents us with dramatically growing challenges around the globe.", "filename": "2022-12-12_ABG_Statements_Hoeller_2022-2023_en.pdf"}, {"text": "6 percent on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter of 2022. For nonresidential construction, cost increases were lower but still significant at 12.8 percent.

According to Statistics Canada, construction job vacancies reached a record high in the first quarter of 2022 and were double the number of open positions during the same period in 2020. And then there is the impact of construction wages, which were up 6.6 percent in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2021. All of this has made completing projects on time and on budget even harder than in the past, and the situation is unlikely to improve in the foreseeable future. The shortage of trades labor is not expected to get better any time soon and construction technologies have yet to evolve to make up the difference in cost or productivity. Adaptation Key as the Landscape Shifts for Canadian Real Estate What does this mean for real estate companies? For some, it adds further to the need to take a pause on activity.

We have seen initiatives from higher levels of government to encourage faster development approvals by municipalities, new money to incentivize construction of affordable homes, and policy changes aimed at facilitating the building of modestly denser forms of housing, like duplexes, triplexes, and mid-rise buildings, in urban areas currently reserved for single-family units. While the increased acknowledgment of the supply gap is posi- tive and the initiatives in response are welcome, the actions fall have been taking on their own, with one describing efforts to make a small number of units more accessible by modifying deposit structures. One interviewee discussed their efforts to increase efficiencies by shifting certain engineering and construction activities to happen earlier in the design pro- cess. Another interviewee emphasized the need for more collaborative partnerships among industry players, nonprofit organizations, and governments to deliver affordable hous- ing. There are many examples of creative partnerships and approaches to building affordable homes in Canada that, with the right funding and incentives from governments, can make a difference if applied more broadly.

One factor con- tributing to the tight labor market is retirements by those older than the core-age cohort, and with Canadas population aging, we can expect these demographic trends to add to the chal- lenges experienced by sectors like the construction industry. So, what can we do about this?

New building activity did not start to pick up until 2012 onwards, long after the surge in immigration after the turn of the century. On an aggregated basis across top locations, only around 20,000 homes p. a. were built from 2002 to 2011. Thereafter, completion figures rose to over 50,000 units up until 2018. Rising purchase prices, rental growth and higher investor demand made new builds lucrative.

Instead, however, housing construction has been slowing down again since 2019  falling to around 40,000 units by 2021. Building in towns and cities was hampered by the fact that the construction industry was working more or less at capacity, by a shortage of skilled workers and of materials, along with the emergence of protests here and there.

This is illustrated by the huge gap in relation to the number of construction permits issued which amount- ed to almost 5 million m2 in 2021. In addition, new building could ease off further as construction projects are delayed as they are on the housing front because of a shortage of building materials.

Developers are moving upstream in the value chain by lever- aging direct partnerships with national material suppliers to pre-secure and prioritize long-lead building materials and mitigate material shortages where possible.

Defying just about every prediction voiced during the terrifying and uncertain days of the COVID lockdown that began in March 2020, U. S. commercial property markets actually embarked on a remarkable run, with some of the strongest returns, rent growth, and price appreciation rates ever recorded. Not every property type, however: hotels endured their worst and most sustained downturn in memory, while offices suffered an unprecedented and significant cut in usage of space. And not every market: some of the nations strongest gateway mar- kets, like New York City and San Francisco, experienced sharp outflows of residents, businesses, and tenants of all types. But overall and across much of the United States, property markets far outperformed expectations and historical norms. And now, more than two years on, property investors and managers are learning anew that whopping growth and profits eventually fall back to eartha reversion to the mean, to use finance jargon, or simply normalizing, as numerous industry experts we interviewed put it.

As the partner in one lead- ing advisory firm explains, This is one of those cash is king situations where borrowing costs are higher, and if youre an all- cash buyer, those probably represent a disproportionate share of the people in the market today. Meanwhile, the same interest rate increases that reduce lever- aged returns and thus demand for real estate also make bonds and other interest-bearing investments more compelling. As the head of real estate banking at one investment bank explains, Rising bond yields are going to mean that real estate and other alternatives are all going to be facing less availability of capital and some outflows. And while interest rates are increasing, equity and bond prices have been falling, triggering the denominator effect for some institutional investors with asset allocations that must remain in balance. The denominator effect can be magnified because CRE values in a portfolio are generally appraisal-based, which tend to be backward-looking.

Discussions with numerous participants from all corners of the industry confirm that many investors have moved to the sidelinesor to other types of assets like equities and bonds. Indeed, the recent surge may well reflect a last gasp to get deals done before the expected increase in interest rates. Fewer Investors Fewer investors and lenders will be providing capital for assets, according to this years Emerging Trends survey: expectations of availability declined for every one of the 13 equity and debt capital sources. Over the past decade, CRE markets benefited from a substantial capital inflow as alternative investment classes have gained wider acceptance and real estate offered compel- ling risk-adjusted returns. Now, some of those inflows look to reverse. Investor interest is still healthy, but not what it was. Instead of seven or 10 competing offers for sale, theres now two or three, which I think thats normal, says the head of an investment firm. Thats normalizing, too.

The result has been a significant disruption to the Canadian real estate market. But while the changing environment in 2022 has been a shock for some, the long-term outlook is positive, since the fundamental underpinnings of the Canadian property market remain strong. This is why now is the time to invest in solutions to create value beyond the short-term uncertainty. concern previously was about too much capital creating even more competition for deals and pushing up prices for assets, the opposite is true now due in large part to a succession of interest rate increases by the Bank of Canada. Lenders, according to interviewees, have been tightening bor- rowing requirements that, coming on top of higher financing costs, are making it harder for real estate companies to raise capital and move projects forward.

To start with, we look at whether real estate prices currently fully reflect the move to higher interest rates and what prospects are for the market going forward. We also highlight opportunities for investors in the current environment, and what their strategy can be. We discuss how they can position their portfolios, and which sectors we think are the most defensive. We then look at prospects for the life sciences sector against a backdrop of slower VC funding. This follows a period of strong growth in the sector and a lot of investor interest. We also dive into student housing in the US, another sector booming among investors, and what impact demographic trends might have on it. In addition, we analyze how opportunistic and value-add managers will need to adopt their strategies now that interest rates are higher, and how their ability to generate out-size returns simply by adding leverage is gone. So, a number of important topics for us and investors to consider. We hope you find our answers insightful and useful in determining your strategy and thinking about some of the key questions in real estate as we move into the new year.

Total returns for the institutional-quality real estate in the NCREIF Property Index (NPI) soared to over 20 percent in the four quarters through mid-2022, almost three times the 20-year average. But returns will be coming down. The 43 economists and ana- lysts surveyed in October 2022 by ULIs Center for Real Estate Economics and Capital Markets expect total returns to drop to 3.8 percent in 2023, and recover to a moderate 7 percent in 2024. That is to say, more normal returns. That outlook tracks with the collective wisdom of respondents to this years Emerging Trends survey. More than half believe that capitalization rates are heading up next year and returns are coming down, primarily due to rising interest rates and cost of capital, which was the top economic concern voiced in our survey. After more than a decade of lower for longer, the Fed is finally normalizing interest rates closer to historical levels. Those rising interest rates are already driving up debt costs and thus the costs to acquire and develop property, reducing leveraged returns.

Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs. We have already started to see cap rates and yields rise in many markets, with the most rapid adjustment taking place in the UK. However, we do not think that prices fully reflect higher interest rates yet. To assess when values might bottom out, we can look to past downturns and the listed market for guidance. In the Global Financial Crisis, for example, global capital values bottomed out in 4Q09, while GDP across global real estate markets troughed three quarters earlier, in 1Q09, as did global listed real estate prices1. Market downturns usually present opportunities, and one we expect for investors in 2023 is a correction in pricing as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. Although we do not expect large amounts of distress in the market, we do expect some, already apparent in parts of the UK market. This should allow investors access to assets at attractive pricing. The early 1990s downturn was longer, with US capital values continuing to decline into 1995.

The Push and Pull of Trends: Rentership Rising Broad-stroke household demographics point irrefutably to strong secular demand for multifamily rental apartment development.

S. domes- tic migration and mobility continues at over 27 million movers each year. Financial factorsgiven that runaway costs and high mortgage interest rates will price more households out of homeownership as an optionwill determine many of their decisions, as has long been the case. What is different over the past several years has been growth in discretionary rental households, also known as rent-by-choice households.

Two, demand gathered speed and sweep as people sought larger living spaces to balance remote work and household life, and more outdoor living options.  Three, constrained construction of new supply, and a price run-up on the single-family for-sale front, spilled over into expanded apartment demand.  Lastly, compounding the effects of these four dramatic imbalances came the rocket fuel of a global capital rotation toward de-risked assets . Outsized demand, a sudden spike in remote work mobility, constricted supply, and floods of money with nowhere better to goa grand slam of anomalies. The U. S. apartment property sectorproviding shelter to 37 mil- lion residents in 21.3 million structures of five or more household units, and contributing $3.4 trillion annually to the U.

The following consequences are likely to result from an environment with structurally high inflation, a tendency toward somewhat higher nominal interest rates and negative real interest rates. First, prices will probably remain under pressure until the end of the interest rate hikes. Second, highly leveraged projects are significantly riskier than in the past decade, which should put the brakes on risk-taking investors. This scenario would therefore continue to allow risk-averse, long-term investors to achieve decent returns. 4.5 Risk scenario for 2023 and later: Structurally high inflation There are two main reasons why inflation could continue to spike upward. First, tax revenues bubble up when inflation rates are high. This allows for a very loose fiscal policy and boosts inflation, again. Second, a labor market in full employment and an acute shortage of labor and skilled workers raises wages. This is particularly true due to the impending wave of retirements, which is likely to increase demand for workers. Strong interest rate hikes increase the risk of recession and the risks to financial market stability. Therefore, central banks may tend to raise interest rates only tentatively. However, the history from the 1970s and the interest rate shock in the early 1980s teaches us that when inflation is structurally high, these risks are eventually accepted in order to bring inflation back under control.

The dominant driver of inflation in the US, Canada and Singapore is that their economies are robust and operating close to full capacity.

Cost Escalations amid Supply Chain Challenges and Labor Shortages On top of concerns about the capital markets are supply chain shortages and delays as well as significant increases in costs for labor and materials.

For nonresidential construction, cost increases were lower but still significant at 12.8 percent. Construction cost increases continued into the second quarter of 2022 amid inflationary pressures throughout the economy. Rising labor shortages are exacerbating the challenges. According to Statistics Canada, construction job vacancies reached a record high in the first quarter of 2022 and were double the number of open positions during the same period in 2020. And then there is the impact of construction wages, which were up 6.6 percent in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2021. All of this has made completing projects on time and on budget even harder than in the past, and the situation is unlikely to improve in the foreseeable future. The shortage of trades labor is not expected to get better any time soon and construction technologies have yet to evolve to make up the difference in cost or productivity. Adaptation Key as the Landscape Shifts for Canadian Real Estate What does this mean for real estate companies? For some, it adds further to the need to take a pause on activity. There have been rising projections, for example, of developers delaying or potentially canceling condo projects as it becomes harder to make the numbers work in these challenging conditions.

The past year has recently seen record surges in housing prices globally, boosted by changes in household living and working patterns, supply and material shortages, and pandemic-era government incentives. Global home prices across 56 countries worldwide increased by as much as 10 through March 2022,16 with home prices in major cities growing by up to 12, the fastest pace since 2004.17 Pricing growth in North America (19) has outpaced Europe (12) and AP (6).18 However, increasing mortgage rates and limited supply have begun to slow home sales in the United States, which declined by 17 from January through May.19 Price increases have also drawn numerous investors into the residential rental sector. In the United States, 18 of single-family homes sold in the fourth quarter of 2021 were purchased by an institutional investor, the largest institutional share in more than 20 years.20 European residential investment has surged lately as well, topping 30 of total real estate deal flows through the first quarter of 2022.", "filename": "Deloitte 2023 Commercial Real Estate Outlook.pdf"}, {"text": " By contrast, in February 2023 there was a 14 difference. Taking into account energy-related refurbishment costs for existing properties is likely to explain the divergence. During the housing boom the state of renovation and the energy certificates played a much smaller role. Today, properties that have not been refurbished or have been refurbished to a minor extent are regularly traded at a discount. In the long term, the discount is likely to increase. On the supply side, the shortage of labor and skilled workers is likely to intensify over the decade as a whole. As a result, the ambitious new construction and refurbishment targets will be difficult to achieve. On the demand side, the rise in energy prices and the consideration of the costs of climate change are likely to lead to a shift away from buildings with high emissions and toward low-emission buildings. The CO2 tax is already making energy costs more expensive. In the next few years, the EU taxonomy will require larger companies and institutional investors to publish their ESG footprint annually. The way companies generate profits will thus come into focus. Consumers and the public can then vote with their feet in a more targeted way and denounce misconduct or persistent underperformance, which in turn is likely to have an impact on corporate performance.

Higher-barrier locations, on the other hand, may sustain higher rent growth for longer. Construction Is Battling Supply Chain Issues Real estate developers across the United States are confronting rising construction costs. Steel, concrete, and roofing materials contribute up to 80 percent of typical shell costs. Market price surges since the end of 2019 for these, and other major catego- ries, caused finished construction costs to spike by 50 percent. Construction durations in the broader industry have increased by two to three months, on average, since 2019, due to lon- ger material lead times and increasing contractor backlogs, according to a construction director at a large industrial owner. Advanced material procurement strategies and construction technology can resolve some ongoing construction issues. Developers are moving upstream in the value chain by lever- aging direct partnerships with national material suppliers to pre-secure and prioritize long-lead building materials and mitigate material shortages where possible. Developers are also introducing modularized construction systems to expedite repeatable project elements, such as office tenant improve- ments and in-warehouse restrooms, which reduce on-site construction timelines.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " In the favourable case, clean-up costs will be lower in the next decade than they are today due to economies of scale and technological progress.

This could change as the climate crisis worsens, with both direct and indirect effects on housing demand. In regions with a higher likelihood of extreme weather events, housing demand is reduced due to a lower quality of life. For example, there could be a direct negative impact from rationing water to water the garden or fill up the swimming pool in the more arid regions. Fires are also more likely and tend to increase there. Heavily damaged forests or fields are also likely to dampen demand for housing, especially if such events become more frequent and nature fails to fully regenerate.", "filename": "2023_Housing_market_outlook__Price_dip_and_interes.pdf"}, {"text": " In the case of unrefurbished and slightly refurbished buildings, the pricing-in of refurbishment costs also has a dampening effect on prices. This is all the more true as legislators are loudly considering tightening up replacement and refurbishment obligations. The main price driver is the fundamental supply shortage. In 2023, according to our calculations, 59 of the 126 cities have higher demand than supply. The situation improves only slowly over the decade, according to our projections. In 2030, 35 cities still have a supply shortage. These are mainly the cities with high populations. The shortages are also likely to radiate to their neighbouring cities and entire regions. However, there are significant differences. The metropolitan areas with a high supply shortage over the entire decade include Berlin, Frankfurt, Hanover, Heidelberg, Cologne, Leipzig, Stuttgart, and Munich. According to our calculations, the supply shortage will end in 2025 in Dsseldorf and Hamburg, while the market has eased in Bremen and Nuremberg. For many years, we have pointed out in our housing market outlook that these cities are likely to have higher interest rate sensitivity. Now the litmus test is upon us. In addition to the fundamental supply shortage, there are a number of other factors that tend to raise prices. For example, adjusted for inflation, the price decline in 2022 was already very strong. In addition, the very negative real interest rates are currently an incentive to invest.", "filename": "2023_Housing_market_outlook__Price_dip_and_interes.pdf"}, {"text": " In particular, households with relatively high incomes are likely to consider low-emission rental housing. In this case, rent increases should also be easier to implement. It is unclear to what extent higher prices and rents will cover the costs of new construction or renovation. However, if the heat turnaround is to succeed, the state is likely to provide more incentives here again in the future. Both the draft amendment to the Building Energy Act and the modernization package hold out the prospect of subsidies. An ideal time for renovation could therefore be as soon as the subsidy situation brightens and the German government launches new subsidy programs. The current construction recession and falling material costs may also provide an opportunity to place orders. Also, due to presumably significantly higher wages as a result of the worsening shortage of labor and skilled workers, early refurbishment is recommended. Moreover, as described, we expect demand to outstrip supply of refurbished properties for many years to come. The frontrunners are therefore likely to achieve not only lower refurbishment costs, but also higher prices and rents, and thus higher returns overall. It is also advisable to develop a refurbishment strategy. Properties that are easy to refurbish are probably a better starting point than buildings with high emissions, where emissions reduction is often disproportionately expensive. The focus is likely to be on serial renovations in particular. Once positive experience has been gained with the new method, economies of scale could reduce costs substantially.", "filename": "2023_Housing_market_outlook__Price_dip_and_interes.pdf"}, {"text": " Explains the director of an investment institute who developed housing earlier in his career, A lot of the homebuilders, when the Great Recession happened, were stuck with inventory, said, Were not doing that again.

The construction sector as a whole hasnt returned to the peak we saw prior to the Great Recession.

All these factors are conspiring to limit housing construction far below population growth.

Reflecting the views of many experts we interviewed, one senior investment banker says, Transactions are being done at cap rates that are anywhere from 25 to 75 basis points wider than they werebut there is not any conviction that these are the right levels. That translates into a 5 to 15 percent drop in values so far, with more to come. But there are too few assets trading now to know for sure. Buyers are concerned about overpaying.

As the partner in one lead- ing advisory firm explains, This is one of those cash is king situations where borrowing costs are higher, and if youre an all- cash buyer, those probably represent a disproportionate share of the people in the market today. Meanwhile, the same interest rate increases that reduce lever- aged returns and thus demand for real estate also make bonds and other interest-bearing investments more compelling. As the head of real estate banking at one investment bank explains, Rising bond yields are going to mean that real estate and other alternatives are all going to be facing less availability of capital and some outflows. And while interest rates are increasing, equity and bond prices have been falling, triggering the denominator effect for some institutional investors with asset allocations that must remain in balance.

Ulrich Hller on portfolio allocations to real estate: Most investors have continuously increased their portfolio allocation to real estate over recent years. Of course, there has been a slowdown now. Some investors initially halted their net acquisitions in response to this, also because bonds have become more attractive for them again. And yet, we do not see a sustained exodus of capital investments from the real estate asset class, which has gained dramatically in importance over the last decade, has become significantly more professional, and will thus remain a long-term component of portfolios.

Our expectation is that transaction activity will be below average in 2023, but start to recover in some sectors later in the year. While unleveraged buyers are not directly impacted by higher interest rates, they are also shifting their pricing and buying activity. They are adjusting their cost of capital in response to the broader capital markets, and unleveraged or low-leverage buyers are capital constrained as well. Higher interest rates have hurt the value of investors broader investment portfolios, triggering the so-called denominator effect, contributing to less competitive and less aggressive pricing for real estate.

This situation could only persist if the number of equity buyers is sufficiently large. Indeed, such investors are currently quite active and are taking advantage of the lower prices for purchases. However, we think it unlikely that the existing equity volume will be sufficient to anchor prices below the cost of financing. The fact that the increase in initial yields is nevertheless likely to be comparatively flat is also due to the mostly comfortable financing situation on the part of the landlords. Apart from the project development segment, we expect few forced sales. We rule out a wave of non-performing loans like after the financial crisis.

October inflation at 3.6 was the highest in four decades, but modest versus other countries. The pressure was also largely imported while domestic inflation stayed benign. In that context, maintaining the loose monetary policy appears the right thing to do. However, something has to give due to this diverging policy stance versus elsewhere. JPY succumbed to market forces and fell to a 32-year low as a result, putting pressure on the Bank of Japans (BoJ) decision. In reaction, the Ministry of Finance intervened in the FX market for the first time since 1998 to stabilize the currency.

Sectors including life sciences, student accommodation, cold storage logistics and self- storage where there are strong structural drivers to support rental growth, are expected to see the greatest value protection. This was welcome news for markets. While unlikely to change the JPY direction, we take comfort that both the government and the BoJ are on the same page. First, this helps to buy time until the US Fed softens its hawkish stance. Second, there is also a positive implication that the next BoJ governor due to be appointed in April 2023 will not deviate materially.

The following consequences are likely to result from an environment with structurally high inflation, a tendency toward somewhat higher nominal interest rates and negative real interest rates.

First, tax revenues bubble up when inflation rates are high. This allows for a very loose fiscal policy and boosts inflation, again. Second, a labor market in full employment and an acute shortage of labor and skilled workers raises wages. This is particularly true due to the impending wave of retirements, which is likely to increase demand for workers. Strong interest rate hikes increase the risk of recession and the risks to financial market stability. Therefore, central banks may tend to raise interest rates only tentatively. However, the history from the 1970s and the interest rate shock in the early 1980s teaches us that when inflation is structurally high, these risks are eventually accepted in order to bring inflation back under control.

Bond yields, which had descended into negative territory over decades, have risen sharply as inflation has climbed. Ten-year Bund yields increased from minus 0.4 per cent last December to nearly 1.8 per cent in June 2022, before slipping back to just over 1.5 per cent by the beginning of September. This has eroded the yield advantage of real estate investment. Although initial rental yields for commercial real estate and residential portfolios have fallen in a similar way to bond yields in recent years, their high yield advantage largely continued until 2021. Furthermore, financing costs for prime properties in the top locations are in some cases higher than the initi- al rental yield, and borrowed capital can no longer therefore be used to raise the total return. Initial rental yields of well below 3 per cent have become less attractive to investors. True, there are signs of an increase in rental yields.

The 43 economists and ana- lysts surveyed in October 2022 by ULIs Center for Real Estate Economics and Capital Markets expect total returns to drop to 3.8 percent in 2023, and recover to a moderate 7 percent in 2024. That is to say, more normal returns. That outlook tracks with the collective wisdom of respondents to this years Emerging Trends survey. More than half believe that capitalization rates are heading up next year and returns are coming down, primarily due to rising interest rates and cost of capital, which was the top economic concern voiced in our survey. After more than a decade of lower for longer, the Fed is finally normalizing interest rates closer to historical levels.

We have already started to see cap rates and yields rise in many markets, with the most rapid adjustment taking place in the UK. However, we do not think that prices fully reflect higher interest rates yet. To assess when values might bottom out, we can look to past downturns and the listed market for guidance. In the Global Financial Crisis, for example, global capital values bottomed out in 4Q09, while GDP across global real estate markets troughed three quarters earlier, in 1Q09, as did global listed real estate prices1. Market downturns usually present opportunities, and one we expect for investors in 2023 is a correction in pricing as the market adjusts to higher interest rates.

In our main scenario, we therefore also assume slightly falling prime rents for the coming year. In 2024, too, the downside risk outweighs the growth opportunities for rents in view of further rising vacancy rates. This could change from 2025 onwards, because the current environment of high financing and construction costs will lead to significantly fewer project developments being started. There could then be a lack of new construction space, at least, and this could lead to rising rents in the prime segment. Logistics markets Private households and the manufacturing sector are suffering particularly from the current and foreseeable macroeconomic environment. The former are facing a massive real loss of purchasing power due to high inflation and will have to reduce their consumption. The latter will be squeezed by rising energy costs and lower global demand. If fewer goods are bought as well as produced, this puts a double burden on the demand for logistics space. After rising to record levels until recently, take-up is expected to fall in 2023. A rising number of insolvencies, especially among small and medium-sized enterprises, could also lead to higher vacancy rates in the small-space segment.

The urgency to secure more space, paired with delays in supply and rising replacement costs, pushed rents to historic highs while vacancies fell to record lows. At the same time, capital market dynamics began to shift, marked by repricing and a pullback in volume. E-Commerce Holds Strong, Despite a Return to In-Store Shopping Consumer spending patterns returned to in-store shopping as local economies reopened, but the future of retail still relies on e-commerce. Why? Because consumers prefer the conve- nience and choice of shopping online.

At the end of the third quarter of 2022, prime yields in all major market segments were below the cost of debt capital . This situation could only persist if the number of equity buyers is sufficiently large. Indeed, such investors are currently quite active and are taking advantage of the lower prices for purchases. However, we think it unlikely that the existing equity volume will be sufficient to anchor prices below the cost of financing. The fact that the increase in initial yields is nevertheless likely to be comparatively flat is also due to the mostly comfortable financing situation on the part of the landlords. Apart from the project development segment, we expect few forced sales. We rule out a wave of non-performing loans like after the financial crisis. Nevertheless, the steep rise in interest rates is likely to put individual landlords under stress, especially in the value-add and opportunistic segments, where financing durations are typically short.

Our expectation is that transaction activity will be below average in 2023, but start to recover in some sectors later in the year. While unleveraged buyers are not directly impacted by higher interest rates, they are also shifting their pricing and buying activity. They are adjusting their cost of capital in response to the broader capital markets, and unleveraged or low-leverage buyers are capital constrained as well. Higher interest rates have hurt the value of investors broader investment portfolios, triggering the so-called denominator effect, contributing to less competitive and less aggressive pricing for real estate.

However, we do not think that prices fully reflect higher interest rates yet. To assess when values might bottom out, we can look to past downturns and the listed market for guidance. In the Global Financial Crisis, for example, global capital values bottomed out in 4Q09, while GDP across global real estate markets troughed three quarters earlier, in 1Q09, as did global listed real estate prices1.

October inflation at 3.6 was the highest in four decades, but modest versus other countries. The pressure was also largely imported while domestic inflation stayed benign. In that context, maintaining the loose monetary policy appears the right thing to do. However, something has to give due to this diverging policy stance versus elsewhere. JPY succumbed to market forces and fell to a 32-year low as a result, putting pressure on the Bank of Japans (BoJ) decision. In reaction, the Ministry of Finance intervened in the FX market for the first time since 1998 to stabilize the currency.

The bid- ask spread for private real estate should eventually close and transactions will resume in earnest at a rebased level.  In the meantime, investment styles that are less sensitive to volatility in values should be contemplated, such as floating-rate lending with a comfortable cushion from lower loan-to-value ratios.", "filename": "isa-outlook-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " And second, in a period of high inflation, the value of the income of an asset will erode unless it can generate rental growth. Higher yielding assets generally come from sectors with weak occupational demand, hence the risk of void periods and negative rental growth are much higher, particularly during a period of economic stress. Sectors including life sciences, student accommodation, cold storage logistics and self- storage where there are strong structural drivers to support rental growth, are expected to see the greatest value protection. This was welcome news for markets. While unlikely to change the JPY direction, we take comfort that both the government and the BoJ are on the same page. First, this helps to buy time until the US Fed softens its hawkish stance. Second, there is also a positive implication that the next BoJ governor due to be appointed in April 2023 will not deviate materially. To be clear, an exit from the ultra-loose policy is possible in the medium-term. However, it will most likely be done in a gradual manner. For 2023, at least, the current policy should stay and the chances are even higher now that the peak of global inflation and interest rates are drawing close.", "filename": "global-real-estate-markets-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " But today those inputs to the math vary greatly, depending on local circumstances. In Japan, debt costs have moved far less than in other parts of the world, as inflation remains subdued and the Bank of Japan continues to exercise yield curve control . By contrast, Europes real estate yield starting point was exceptionally low and market interest rates have moved up much more markedly, making the math that much more impactful. Government policy also matters. As central banks seek to choke off inflation by tightening monetary policy, there is at least the reasonable expectation that some of that inflation will be passed into rents and thus property cash flows. But when governments employ long-term borrowing to bail out energy consumers in the short term, as is necessary in Europe, interest rates are pushed up further and the impact on property values may be more detrimental. As the UKs recent experience would suggest, credit markets can react swiftly to reflect changes in perceived debt sustainability.

Buyers not using leverage have an opportunity to set pricing at the margin and they have been among the few active players.

If the Bank of Japan (BoJ) remains committed to keeping interest rates near zero, currency intervention, such as yen-buying to prevent further depreciation, could be on the table again.

Finally, looking across the globe, another potential opportunity for investors in 2023 is Japan, due to accretive hedging gains for investment into this market.

S. commercial property markets actually embarked on a remarkable run, with some of the strongest returns, rent growth, and price appreciation rates ever recorded. Not every property type, however: hotels endured their worst and most sustained downturn in memory, while offices suffered an unprecedented and significant cut in usage of space. And not every market: some of the nations strongest gateway mar- kets, like New York City and San Francisco, experienced sharp outflows of residents, businesses, and tenants of all types. But overall and across much of the United States, property markets far outperformed expectations and historical norms. And now, more than two years on, property investors and managers are learning anew that whopping growth and profits eventually fall back to eartha reversion to the mean, to use finance jargon, or simply normalizing, as numerous industry experts we interviewed put it.

Theres got to be this normalization. So, what does that mean? I think its going to be a little bouncy. Its going to be a little bit turbulent.

Still, Weve Changed Some  The pandemic forced structural shifts in how and where we live, work, and recreate in ways that seem destinated to endure.  Online spending is receding from its pandemic peaks but is not likely to revert to pre-pandemic levels.

Investment markets Looking back at the year 2022, the real estate investment market was primarily characterised by the interest rate shock. The steep turnaround in interest rates triggered a price correction on the real estate markets from the spring onwards, whereby the uncertainty about the extent and duration of the correction led to many investors temporarily withdrawing from the market. The turnaround in interest rates now appears to be largely complete and on this basis, we believe that a reliable price level should re-emerge on the real estate markets in the course of 2023, possibly as early as the spring. At what level buyers and sellers will come together remains to be seen.

But until that occurs, properties will be offered on the hope that aspirational pricing targets anchored on peak levels will be achieved and a bid-ask gap will persist. Our expectation is that transaction activity will be below average in 2023, but start to recover in some sectors later in the year. While unleveraged buyers are not directly impacted by higher interest rates, they are also shifting their pricing and buying activity. They are adjusting their cost of capital in response to the broader capital markets, and unleveraged or low-leverage buyers are capital constrained as well. Higher interest rates have hurt the value of investors broader investment portfolios, triggering the so-called denominator effect, contributing to less competitive and less aggressive pricing for real estate. Private real estate pricing will adjust most quickly to the reality of higher interest rates in the sectors with the greatest investor interest . The price discovery process will be much slower for sectors already seeing fewer transactions, such as offices.

Successful real estate investing rests on identification of timeless attributes that are successful over the course of several cycles. These attributes must be appropriately priced and they must also adapt to trends in demographics, technology, urbanization and environmental factors. This triangle of timelessness, adaptation and fair value pricing forms the foundation for successful real estate investing.

This prompted central banks to make aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022, with more expected in 2023, along with a mild recession in the economy. Looking back to our 2022 predictions, in general they proved prescient. We expected hybrid working to weigh on the office market and that the polarization between the best and worst assets would continue, which has been the case. We expected retail capital values to bottom out, which they had started to, but are now likely to be impacted by weakening consumer spending.

Wealth tends to be concentrated in larger urban centres with better employment opportunities where the average age of the working population is lower than in regional and more remote communities. Demand for living assets remains strong in most urbanised areas due to demographic growth and the rising number of households, boosted by immigration and the expanding number of younger and older people living alone. The volume of new housing developments is also falling due to increasingly stringent environmental rules, shortages of materials and rising labour costs. Demand continues to outstrip supply, especially in the affordable segment. If the number of new-build projects continues to decline, the valuations of existing stock may hold up relatively well. Increases in mortgage rates mean home ownership will move out of reach of a growing group of people, forcing them to turn to the rental market for accommodation that fits their budgets. Residential real estate is seen as a relatively good inflation hedge as most rental contracts are index-linked but, in our view, it will not be possible to pass on the full level of consumer price rises to tenants.

And (3) Next recession (15), triggered by overly aggressive tightening of monetary policy as governments attempt to tame inflation.

Office: Desperately Seeking Clarity about Its Future Into the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic, we should have clarity about the direction of the future workplace.

Moving beyond sector selection In the US, sector selection is likely to remain important to investors due to the uniquely dim outlook for its office market. But investors can still develop an edge by identifying the best markets and strategies within sectors. There are a wide range of metro areas in North America for an investor to sort through to identify the best targets and there is no shortcut around doing the work to identify the best-positioned markets. The rent growth outlook, in combination with pricing and market risk factors, remain paramount in this selection process.

However, we do not expect a sustainable trend reversal before 2024, by which time the economy should also be picking up speed again. Ulrich Hller on the development of rental prices: Existing rents will increase for two main reasons: rents for commercial real estate are usually index-linked. Taking into account the high inflation rates, this means that rents will increase accordingly. At the same time, the reduced number of development projects will increase the demand for existing properties, therefore putting further upwards pressure on rents. In particular, rents for objects in sought-after locations as well as for high-quality and energy-efficient properties will increase significantly because supply will not be able to meet demand in the foreseeable future.

The divides between property types have come to dominate the impact of asset selection, quality and micro-location, which had been more salient in the past. While sector divides remain, other factors are gaining in relative importance. Winning sectors like residential and logistics have consistently posted stronger returns than pandemic-challenged sectors like retail or hotels . In both public and private markets, the data show that the dispersion between the strongest and weakest performing sectors is exceptionally wide. While the supportive growth dynamics underlying the industrial and residential sectors remain in place globally, the math means that rising debt costs are hitting capital values hard in lower-yielding sectors.

In view of this dynamic, risk-taking investors and those for whom real estate is an investment that needs to be actively managed are likely to get their moneys worth in 2023. Asset management could become the buzzword of the year. In view of the major trends of digitalisation and decarbonisation, it could well be not just a year, but an era of asset management. But that is a topic for another outlook. Conclusion Despite all the uncertainty, one thing seems certain in our view for the real estate year 2023: it will remain challenging for all market players. Investors will be busy digesting the interest rate turnaround for at least the first few months. And many occupiers will increasingly feel the effects of the economic downturn.

Portfolio aggregation strategies with smaller asset sizes that lend themselves to averaging-in with diversified timing of entry points represent another way to cope with volatile and uncertain values.  The inputs to the math are not changing to the same degree in every part of the world. Wherever rate spikes are less intense, or the prospects for rental growth are clearest, transaction activity and prices have been less impacted.  In addition to debt costs, investors should also consider the trajectory of cash flows, which depend on economic fundamentals and real estate occupier market conditions. The differential prospects for real estate cash flows are the subject of the next section. G LO BA L 2 The path of fundamentals will ultimately help determine where values settle Early in 2022, we framed the impact of rising inflation and interest rates on values as a race between debt costs and net operating income growth, as we anticipated that higher inflation would translate into higher rents in some sectors. Currently, it seems that debt costs are mostly winning the race. Ultimately, however, valuations are the result of the interaction between higher debt costs and the path of real estate fundamentals, the prospects for which vary widely across sectors and geographies.

Investors should receive similar ex ante returns for similar risks, or else any free lunches will be arbitraged away. In practice, private market real estate pricing tends to be impacted by broader capital market shifts mainly when there are changes in the cost of real estate debt, since the marginal buyer of income-producing real estate is most often a leveraged buyer. When debt costs rise, the market thins before price pressures are reflected in transactions. This tends to create a time lag between higher interest rates and declines in private equity real estate pricing. In most markets globally, we are now feeling the impact of more expensive real estate debt, which in many cases is no longer accretive to returns at current private market valuations. The math of debt costs and going-in yields is relentless. When the yield starting point is especially low in absolute terms, modest increases in debt costs and yields as measured in basis points mathematically translate into big percentage changes in capital values.", "filename": "isa-outlook-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " Says the regional leader of one global firm, Cap rates have gapped out as interest rates went up. And suddenly, things didnt pencil, and that generated broken deals. The cost of financing for real estate and everything else went up dramatically. And so everything has to be repriced, everything has to be reset. Also limiting investor demand: debt is getting more difficult to obtain, and the Emerging Trends survey expects underwriting standards to get even more rigorous. As the partner in one lead- ing advisory firm explains, This is one of those cash is king situations where borrowing costs are higher, and if youre an all- cash buyer, those probably represent a disproportionate share of the people in the market today. Meanwhile, the same interest rate increases that reduce lever- aged returns and thus demand for real estate also make bonds and other interest-bearing investments more compelling. As the head of real estate banking at one investment bank explains, Rising bond yields are going to mean that real estate and other alternatives are all going to be facing less availability of capital and some outflows. And while interest rates are increasing, equity and bond prices have been falling, triggering the denominator effect for some institutional investors with asset allocations that must remain in balance. The denominator effect can be magnified because CRE values in a portfolio are generally appraisal-based, which tend to be backward-looking. However, the impact on CRE portfolios may not be severe this time.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " around long-term interest rates and pricing than around near-term economic growth and real estate fundamentals. We are reluctant to make investment decisions based solely on a view of future interest rates, but acknowledge that real estate pricing is linked to future interest rates. Given this dynamic, we recommend investors consider a range of interest rate scenarios . Interest rate increases and the relentless math Each time interest rates ticked higher since the GFC, the question of when higher debt costs would impact real estate values was asked. It was a speculative question, with the underlying assumption that rate increases thus far had not yet impacted values. Regardless of the answer then, it became very clear in 2022 that the relentless math of higher borrowing rates was having an impact on leveraged returns and asset values . The boost investors were getting from borrowing has shifted to a drag on a cash basis, but with unleveraged internal rates of return generally above borrowing rates, leverage is still marginally accretive on a total return basis. However, with less lift from borrowing, leveraged buyers are largely out of the market . Higher borrowing rates are a function of both higher indices and increased borrowing spreads. Lending volume is down significantly and lenders are becoming more conservative. The supply of debt capital from large money center banks is down due to large positions taken in the first half of 2022 coupled with stress testing.", "filename": "isa-outlook-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " As such, evidence of the most significant repricing to date has been concentrated in the lowest- yielding sectors, where transactions have held up most. This has surprised some observers since these low-yielding property types are mostly the winning sectors of recent years and they continue to possess attractive growth profiles. That some of the largest recent value declines may be occurring in the most sought- after property types, such as logistics and residential, might come as a shock after years of banner outperformance, especially during the pandemic. Even so, these property types remain the strongest performers over longer trailing periods and values have also fallen in the less favored sectors, although such adjustments are masked by lower price transparency in these property types. This repricing has been labeled mechanical by some because it is a function of exogenous debt assumptions increasing in investors spreadsheets. An alternative way to look at it is that it is mechanical because debt pricing is a mechanism by which real estate is linked to the broader capital markets, through lenders cost of funds. Another such mechanism is the denominator effect. This involves comparing real-time values from public markets to lagging valuation-based assessments of private market portfolios, causing some investors to conclude that they are suddenly overweight in the unlisted assets compared to their target allocation. Either way, the downward direction of the pricing pressure is clear and it will likely persist as long as the all-in cost of debt is dilutive to leveraged returns. Given the same inputs, the math works the same way all over the world.", "filename": "isa-outlook-2023.pdf"}, {"text": "5 Spiking rates drive rapid tightening of financial conditions Cost of capital rising sharply in most geographies Nominal corporate bond yields 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 7 0 n a J 8 0 n a J 9 0 n a J 0 1 n a J 1 1 n a J 2 1 n a J 3 1 n a J 4 1 n a J 5 1 n a J 6 1 n a J 7 1 n a J 8 1 n a J 9 1 n a J 0 2 n a J 1 2 n a J 2 2 n a J US C.

LOOKING AHEAD  The relentless math of higher interest rates will continue to weigh heavily on real estate values, at least until interest rates stabilize as inflation begins to subside. The bid- ask spread for private real estate should eventually close and transactions will resume in earnest at a rebased level.  In the meantime, investment styles that are less sensitive to volatility in values should be contemplated, such as floating-rate lending with a comfortable cushion from lower loan-to-value ratios.", "filename": "isa-outlook-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " We address ESG questions in our separate publication. Page 2 of 8 Our research team gives answers to some key questions facing real estate investors. To start with, we look at whether real estate prices currently fully reflect the move to higher interest rates and what prospects are for the market going forward. We also highlight opportunities for investors in the current environment, and what their strategy can be. We discuss how they can position their portfolios, and which sectors we think are the most defensive. We then look at prospects for the life sciences sector against a backdrop of slower VC funding. This follows a period of strong growth in the sector and a lot of investor interest. We also dive into student housing in the US, another sector booming among investors, and what impact demographic trends might have on it. In addition, we analyze how opportunistic and value-add managers will need to adopt their strategies now that interest rates are higher, and how their ability to generate out-size returns simply by adding leverage is gone. So, a number of important topics for us and investors to consider. We hope you find our answers insightful and useful in determining your strategy and thinking about some of the key questions in real estate as we move into the new year. Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns.", "filename": "global-real-estate-markets-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " When new pricing is established, it will provide market evidence to help brokers supply accurate opinions of value and enable sellers to have realistic pricing expectations. But until that occurs, properties will be offered on the hope that aspirational pricing targets anchored on peak levels will be achieved and a bid-ask gap will persist. Our expectation is that transaction activity will be below average in 2023, but start to recover in some sectors later in the year. While unleveraged buyers are not directly impacted by higher interest rates, they are also shifting their pricing and buying activity. They are adjusting their cost of capital in response to the broader capital markets, and unleveraged or low-leverage buyers are capital constrained as well. Higher interest rates have hurt the value of investors broader investment portfolios, triggering the so-called denominator effect, contributing to less competitive and less aggressive pricing for real estate. Private real estate pricing will adjust most quickly to the reality of higher interest rates in the sectors with the greatest investor interest . The price discovery process will be much slower for sectors already seeing fewer transactions, such as offices.

Notably, there are few signs of distress. Balance sheets are generally strong, lever- age is low, and values have not fallen very far, so few assets are underwater with their debt. Moreover, replacement financing is generally still available for those who need it, if at a higher price and with tighter underwriting.

In Japan, debt costs have moved far less than in other parts of the world, as inflation remains subdued and the Bank of Japan continues to exercise yield curve control . By contrast, Europes real estate yield starting point was exceptionally low and market interest rates have moved up much more markedly, making the math that much more impactful. Government policy also matters. As central banks seek to choke off inflation by tightening monetary policy, there is at least the reasonable expectation that some of that inflation will be passed into rents and thus property cash flows. But when governments employ long-term borrowing to bail out energy consumers in the short term, as is necessary in Europe, interest rates are pushed up further and the impact on property values may be more detrimental. As the UKs recent experience would suggest, credit markets can react swiftly to reflect changes in perceived debt sustainability.

By 2030, the region will account for 66 of the global middle-class population compared with 30 in 2009. This increase will accelerate the existing trend of urbanization, which means that population and economic growth will be higher in large cities, including the surrounding metropolitan areas, compared with national averages.

Indeed, the consensus of experts we interviewed this summer was that the Fed would cease tightening by the end of 2022 and start cutting rates again in mid-2023. That sentiment now appears optimistic. Inflation is going to be a little stickier than people think, said an investment banking executive we interviewed during the summer, whose views turned out to be more prescient. Sentiment started changing in late August when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell gave his annual speech to fellow central bankers affirming the Fed view that infla- tion is not nearly under control, jolting markets.

Interest rate increases and the relentless math Each time interest rates ticked higher since the GFC, the question of when higher debt costs would impact real estate values was asked. It was a speculative question, with the underlying assumption that rate increases thus far had not yet impacted values. Regardless of the answer then, it became very clear in 2022 that the relentless math of higher borrowing rates was having an impact on leveraged returns and asset values . The boost investors were getting from borrowing has shifted to a drag on a cash basis, but with unleveraged internal rates of return generally above borrowing rates, leverage is still marginally accretive on a total return basis. However, with less lift from borrowing, leveraged buyers are largely out of the market . Higher borrowing rates are a function of both higher indices and increased borrowing spreads.

In an August 2022 survey by the National Association of Business Economics, only a quarter of economists were even somewhat confident that the Fed could bring down inflation to its target range without causing a recession. Worrying signs out of Europe in early autumn and expectations of soaring heating bills this coming winter add to the gloomy global economic outlook. These conditions would be problematic for property markets: slowing or falling economic growth dampens tenant demand, while higher interest rates raise the cost of developing or acquiring properties. Both factors would cut returns and reduce values. Indeed, rising interest rates and uncertainty over future market conditions are already killing deals since sellers have not been ready to capitulate to buyers growing demands for price concessions, as we discuss in our capital markets trend.

But for all that, most commercial real estate professionals we interviewed for this years Emerging Trends remain reasonably upbeat about longer-term prospects. Not everyone is as sanguine as the CEO of an investment management firm who provided our opening quote, and there certainly are some troubling risks ahead for the industry. But the consensus mood seems to be one of cautious optimism that we will ride out any near-term slump and be well positioned for another period of sustained growth and strong returns. It makes sense that real estate experts would take the long view given the nature of real estate assets: buildings take a long time to conceive and develop. Even simply acquiring one typically takes more time than buying just about any other type of financial asset, and they are usually held for longer dura- tions.

Page 2 of 8 Our research team gives answers to some key questions facing real estate investors. To start with, we look at whether real estate prices currently fully reflect the move to higher interest rates and what prospects are for the market going forward. We also highlight opportunities for investors in the current environment, and what their strategy can be. We discuss how they can position their portfolios, and which sectors we think are the most defensive. We then look at prospects for the life sciences sector against a backdrop of slower VC funding. This follows a period of strong growth in the sector and a lot of investor interest. We also dive into student housing in the US, another sector booming among investors, and what impact demographic trends might have on it. In addition, we analyze how opportunistic and value-add managers will need to adopt their strategies now that interest rates are higher, and how their ability to generate out-size returns simply by adding leverage is gone. So, a number of important topics for us and investors to consider. We hope you find our answers insightful and useful in determining your strategy and thinking about some of the key questions in real estate as we move into the new year. Do real estate prices currently reflect the rapid shift to higher interest rates? It takes time for real estate markets to fully reflect changes in the economy, particularly during downturns.", "filename": "global-real-estate-markets-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " On the other hand, sellers dont want to sell their assets short and then see them retraded at higher prices once the markets improve and few suffer from the financial distress that forces them to. It all translates into fewer deals. One senior adviser to institutional investors said, Its pen- cils down in investment committee. We cant get an acquisition or disposition approved in investment committee at this time. The fundamental issue for many investors is how long the Fed will keep raising rates. Many people we consulted in the summer believed that the Fed will finish hiking by the end of 2022 and could start lowering again by mid-2023. However, Chairman Powells comments at the end of August led more observers to believe that relief will not come until at least 2024 and seemed to precipitate a sharp market selloff. But everyone agrees that deal volumes will not return until market players better understand the Feds playbookwhich, in turn, hinges on when inflation can be tamed. As the U. S. head of real estate at one investment bank explained, Thats going to create more clarity, and then some of the volatility comes down, and thats the opportunity to start buying. Deal flow will also require investors to recognize that pricing expectations have changed.

And suddenly, things didnt pencil, and that generated broken deals. The cost of financing for real estate and everything else went up dramatically. And so everything has to be repriced, everything has to be reset. Also limiting investor demand: debt is getting more difficult to obtain, and the Emerging Trends survey expects underwriting standards to get even more rigorous. As the partner in one lead- ing advisory firm explains, This is one of those cash is king situations where borrowing costs are higher, and if youre an all- cash buyer, those probably represent a disproportionate share of the people in the market today. Meanwhile, the same interest rate increases that reduce lever- aged returns and thus demand for real estate also make bonds and other interest-bearing investments more compelling. As the head of real estate banking at one investment bank explains, Rising bond yields are going to mean that real estate and other alternatives are all going to be facing less availability of capital and some outflows. And while interest rates are increasing, equity and bond prices have been falling, triggering the denominator effect for some institutional investors with asset allocations that must remain in balance. The denominator effect can be magnified because CRE values in a portfolio are generally appraisal-based, which tend to be backward-looking. However, the impact on CRE portfolios may not be severe this time.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": "4 How can investors respond to these developments? The following consequences are likely to result from an environment with structurally high inflation, a tendency toward somewhat higher nominal interest rates and negative real interest rates. First, prices will probably remain under pressure until the end of the interest rate hikes. Second, highly leveraged projects are significantly riskier than in the past decade, which should put the brakes on risk-taking investors. This scenario would therefore continue to allow risk-averse, long-term investors to achieve decent returns. 4.5 Risk scenario for 2023 and later: Structurally high inflation There are two main reasons why inflation could continue to spike upward. First, tax revenues bubble up when inflation rates are high. This allows for a very loose fiscal policy and boosts inflation, again. Second, a labor market in full employment and an acute shortage of labor and skilled workers raises wages. This is particularly true due to the impending wave of retirements, which is likely to increase demand for workers. Strong interest rate hikes increase the risk of recession and the risks to financial market stability. Therefore, central banks may tend to raise interest rates only tentatively. However, the history from the 1970s and the interest rate shock in the early 1980s teaches us that when inflation is structurally high, these risks are eventually accepted in order to bring inflation back under control.

And Canadas stability and immigration trends have made the country an attractive place in which to invest. Then came 2022, with its mix of interest rate increases, high levels of inflation, and a geopolitical environment that has created uncertainty throughout the global economy. The result has been a significant disruption to the Canadian real estate market. But while the changing environment in 2022 has been a shock for some, the long-term outlook is positive, since the fundamental underpinnings of the Canadian property market remain strong. This is why now is the time to invest in solutions to create value beyond the short-term uncertainty. concern previously was about too much capital creating even more competition for deals and pushing up prices for assets, the opposite is true now due in large part to a succession of interest rate increases by the Bank of Canada. Lenders, according to interviewees, have been tightening bor- rowing requirements that, coming on top of higher financing costs, are making it harder for real estate companies to raise capital and move projects forward. This, in turn, is leading to reduced competition for deals during a period of price discov- ery as sellers and buyers find themselves at odds over pricing expectations and valuations as some real estate assets come under pressure.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " 6.3 Risk scenario: Further interest rate shock.

However, this will only persist if high inflation eases again and falls below the 2 target. Otherwise, there is a threat of further interest rate tightening. In the short term, the current high uncertainty and financial stability risks are likely to limit the potential for interest rate hikes.

For example, inflation in the 1970s ended with the Volcker shock and massive interest rate hikes. These led not only to a severe recession, but also to the Latin American crisis. So if inflation remains structurally high, sooner or later interest rates could rise again sharply. House prices could then come under renewed pressure. In this scenario, however, almost all investments are likely to lose value, and investments in the German housing market could still perform relatively well compared with other asset classes.

Economic growth in China in 2023 should be below historical averages, but strong enough to make it one of the fastest growing large economies. In Japan, yield curve control comes at the cost of a weak yen. If the Bank of Japan (BoJ) remains committed to keeping interest rates near zero, currency intervention, such as yen-buying to prevent further depreciation, could be on the table again. However, currency intervention has rarely been successful absent the cooperation from other central banks. Any changes to the yield control approach are likely to come after BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kurodas term concludes in April 2023. Nonetheless, most of the challenges Japan is facing are externally driven, while domestic-driven fundamentals remain relatively healthy.

Sectors including life sciences, student accommodation, cold storage logistics and self- storage where there are strong structural drivers to support rental growth, are expected to see the greatest value protection. This was welcome news for markets. While unlikely to change the JPY direction, we take comfort that both the government and the BoJ are on the same page. First, this helps to buy time until the US Fed softens its hawkish stance. Second, there is also a positive implication that the next BoJ governor due to be appointed in April 2023 will not deviate materially. To be clear, an exit from the ultra-loose policy is possible in the medium-term. However, it will most likely be done in a gradual manner.

In Japan, debt costs have moved far less than in other parts of the world, as inflation remains subdued and the Bank of Japan continues to exercise yield curve control . By contrast, Europes real estate yield starting point was exceptionally low and market interest rates have moved up much more markedly, making the math that much more impactful. Government policy also matters. As central banks seek to choke off inflation by tightening monetary policy, there is at least the reasonable expectation that some of that inflation will be passed into rents and thus property cash flows. But when governments employ long-term borrowing to bail out energy consumers in the short term, as is necessary in Europe, interest rates are pushed up further and the impact on property values may be more detrimental.

Investors should receive similar ex ante returns for similar risks, or else any free lunches will be arbitraged away. In practice, private market real estate pricing tends to be impacted by broader capital market shifts mainly when there are changes in the cost of real estate debt, since the marginal buyer of income-producing real estate is most often a leveraged buyer. When debt costs rise, the market thins before price pressures are reflected in transactions. This tends to create a time lag between higher interest rates and declines in private equity real estate pricing. In most markets globally, we are now feeling the impact of more expensive real estate debt, which in many cases is no longer accretive to returns at current private market valuations.

Interest rate increases and the relentless math Each time interest rates ticked higher since the GFC, the question of when higher debt costs would impact real estate values was asked. It was a speculative question, with the underlying assumption that rate increases thus far had not yet impacted values. Regardless of the answer then, it became very clear in 2022 that the relentless math of higher borrowing rates was having an impact on leveraged returns and asset values . The boost investors were getting from borrowing has shifted to a drag on a cash basis, but with unleveraged internal rates of return generally above borrowing rates, leverage is still marginally accretive on a total return basis. However, with less lift from borrowing, leveraged buyers are largely out of the market . Higher borrowing rates are a function of both higher indices and increased borrowing spreads.

However, persistently high inflation has already started to affect the affordability of index-linked rental properties and office tenants that are under pressure may seek to renegotiate their leases. The European office market is characterised by a large variety of rental contracts and if rental increases are staggered, for example, inflation cannot be passed on fully. At the time of writing, there is little market evidence of repricing of privately owned prime offices, but we estimate that average- quality office values may have fallen by roughly 15 by the end of Q4 2022 since their peak at the end of 2021. This amounts to a yield expansion of about 50bps. A yield correction is also on the cards for prime offices in Europe, but the increase is likely to be more moderate. Broker reports indicate that prime yields already started to move out in some locations between Q1 2022 and Q2 2022, with German cities leading the pack at 30bps. French and Spanish cities posted quarter-on-quarter yield increases of between 15 and 25bps. As risk-free rates are up and expected to remain elevated between 2023 and 2025, we believe office capital values could soften further during the outlook period, and we estimate prime yields in Europe will move out by another 50bps. This would amount to a value loss of around 10 to 15 before stabilization and recovery takes place.", "filename": "bouwinvest_international-market-outlook_2023-2025-1.pdf"}, {"text": " The resultant rise in the cost of debt and the tightening spread between average real estate yields and the risk-free rate will lead to asset repricing, potentially generating opportunities for non-leveraged investors, who may be better placed than leveraged buyers with refinancing commitments.

The tightening - or even negative - spread between real estate yields and 10-year government bonds - a proxy for the risk-free rate - will lead to asset repricing, potentially generating more opportunities for non-leveraged investors. Fundamental occupier demand drivers for residential and logistics real estate are better than those for office and retail properties, while niche segments may generate attractive opportunities.

While there are opportunities for equity funds with dry powder, for funds currently invested, a series of adverse revaluations is likely. Index values declined in the third quarter, but valuation yields remain above tradeable market capitalization rates. However, the current widened bid-ask spread should give way to a normalization of capital markets from new rebased values, likely in the second half of 2023. As central banks become increasingly concerned about economic fundamentals, hiking cycles will also come to an end . Surprises in this area may already be over, with equilibrium policy rates having probably already been priced into swap markets. Policy rates still must get to these stabilized levels, but further upward shocks in rates now seem unlikely, with the possibility for some positive surprises and relief rallies if equilibrium rates end lower than expectations.

Bond yields, which had descended into negative territory over decades, have risen sharply as inflation has climbed. Ten-year Bund yields increased from minus 0.4 per cent last December to nearly 1.8 per cent in June 2022, before slipping back to just over 1.5 per cent by the beginning of September. This has eroded the yield advantage of real estate investment. Although initial rental yields for commercial real estate and residential portfolios have fallen in a similar way to bond yields in recent years, their high yield advantage largely continued until 2021. Furthermore, financing costs for prime properties in the top locations are in some cases higher than the initi- al rental yield, and borrowed capital can no longer therefore be used to raise the total return. Initial rental yields of well below 3 per cent have become less attractive to investors. True, there are signs of an increase in rental yields.

Such problems include those that affect the quality of life and standard of living . These side effects to unfettered growth bring to mind the old joke about the hot restaurant that is so popular that no one wants to go there anymore. The Sun Belt markets are still strong population and business magnets, but they may now draw fewer and different people as their appeal changes. Becoming a 24-Hour City Though still ranked among the highest of all markets, some high-flying Sun Belt metros declined in ratings this year. Housing is more expensive, traffic is getting worse, longtime residents are getting frustrated, and even some newcomers are finding the proverbial grass to be not quite as green as they envisioned. In focus groups with local market experts conducted by ULI district councils across the United States, participants from the Supernovas and some other Sun Belt markets were likelier than members from metro areas with more sluggish economies to cite issues like living costs, housing affordability, and infrastruc- ture quality as being a regional disadvantage.

However, trade fair business could remain weak for a more prolonged period, partly due to the loss of the IAA auto show to the Munich trade fair. Frankfurt is a strong retail location with its two prime locations Zeil and Goethestrae as well as several large shopping centres. Another plus point is the fairly moderate decline in prime rents given the negative conditions. By the end of 2021 they had fallen by around 8 per cent to EUR 275 per m2 and have since remained unchanged. Plans for the City of Frankfurt to play an active role in the development of the city centre - some of which is not very attractive - are also positive. A total of EUR 30m is to be invested in city centre projects, with the aim of upgrading the quality of stay. How- ever, retail is also playing a role here. For example, the Galeria store at the entrance to the Zeil has been remodelled into the Weltstadthaus and has been visibly upgraded while remaining open. The former sports arena building which is also close to the Hauptwache is being demolished and will be replaced by 2024 by a modern commercial building with offices.

The dominant driver of inflation in the US, Canada and Singapore is that their economies are robust and operating close to full capacity.

The following consequences are likely to result from an environment with structurally high inflation, a tendency toward somewhat higher nominal interest rates and negative real interest rates. First, prices will probably remain under pressure until the end of the interest rate hikes. Second, highly leveraged projects are significantly riskier than in the past decade, which should put the brakes on risk-taking investors. This scenario would therefore continue to allow risk-averse, long-term investors to achieve decent returns. 4.5 Risk scenario for 2023 and later: Structurally high inflation There are two main reasons why inflation could continue to spike upward. First, tax revenues bubble up when inflation rates are high. This allows for a very loose fiscal policy and boosts inflation, again. Second, a labor market in full employment and an acute shortage of labor and skilled workers raises wages. This is particularly true due to the impending wave of retirements, which is likely to increase demand for workers. Strong interest rate hikes increase the risk of recession and the risks to financial market stability. Therefore, central banks may tend to raise interest rates only tentatively. However, the history from the 1970s and the interest rate shock in the early 1980s teaches us that when inflation is structurally high, these risks are eventually accepted in order to bring inflation back under control.

The Pandemic: This Time Is Different With the pandemic and the cascade of economic and social policies it set off, five macro apartment industry tailwinds reached gale-force levels:  One, there was a preexisting multigenerational avalanche of both rent-by-choice and rent-by-necessity demand for multifamily rental units.  Two, demand gathered speed and sweep as people sought larger living spaces to balance remote work and household life, and more outdoor living options.  Three, constrained construction of new supply, and a price run-up on the single-family for-sale front, spilled over into expanded apartment demand.  Lastly, compounding the effects of these four dramatic imbalances came the rocket fuel of a global capital rotation toward de-risked assets .

The Future of Single-Family Housing The early 2020s have been a transformative time for the housing industry as the pandemic caused people around the world to reevaluate both where they live and how they live. The United States experienced the Great American Move in which house- holds and businesses relocated to more affordable places, often to buy or rent a home with additional space and a yard, and farther from employment centers. Builders across the country could not keep up with the new demandand supply chain interruptions, labor shortages, and permitting delays during the COVID-19 pandemic did not help matters. As a result, home prices escalated at historic rates. The median new home price in the United States increased 22 percent since the start of 2020 and existing home prices increased 58 percent. 45 Today, the single-family housing industry is on the other side of the rapid run-up in demand and pricesinflation and the rapid escalation of mortgage rates have resulted in a cooldown of the for-sale housing market.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " The July 2022 inventory-to-sales ratio for all retailers was almost 4 percent below average 2019 levels.

The supply-demand relationship is thus out of balance as rarely before . In the next few years, we therefore expect the already very low vacancy rates in most rental housing markets to fall further and rents to rise. From the landlords point of view, the fundamental framework conditions not only remain favourable, the outlook has even improved compared to last year. However, the socially explosive nature of these developments is likely to call government onto the scene. Recently, it was decided to increase the linear depreciation from 2 to 3. For new rental housing that meets the EH-40 standard and the requirements of the Quality Seal for Sustainable Buildings (QNG), it will even be possible to write off 5 of the construction costs over four years. Although these and possibly upcoming decisions will not have an effect on the number of completions in the short term, in the medium term they could significantly boost construction activity in rental housing.

From the point of view of most occupiers, space will therefore remain scarce and expensive, especially since the initially still high inflation will eat up any savings in cold rent through higher costs elsewhere. In view of this dynamic, risk-taking investors and those for whom real estate is an investment that needs to be actively managed are likely to get their moneys worth in 2023. Asset management could become the buzzword of the year. In view of the major trends of digitalisation and decarbonisation, it could well be not just a year, but an era of asset management.

With increasing rent levels, occupiers are now typically looking for high-quality, efficient spaces to match sky- high premiums. To better attract and retain tenants, owners and investors can enhance tenant experiences by leveraging data analytics, and more specifically, special intelligence tools, which can allow tenants to personalize their spaces to maximize productivity.48  Most respondents continue to have well-founded concerns about supply chain disruptions and construction costs due to construction delays and soaring land and materials costs. To address supply constraints, CRE leaders should focus on creative property-use conversions and targeted location strategies that tap into shifting demographic gateways.  Sources of funding may pull back in the near term as firms reassess their risk tolerance as they face volatile market conditions. Real estate owners and investors seeking capital should consider creative, alternative sources, such as looking outside of native jurisdictions for partnerships or approaching debt funds.

Our expectation is that transaction activity will be below average in 2023, but start to recover in some sectors later in the year.

Take-up in Q2 2022 rose to over 1 mil- lion m2  a figure only exceeded seven times in the 50 quarters since 2010. The ear- lier uptick in vacancies has been brought to a halt by an increase in letting activity. Overall, the vacancy rate rose by 1.5 percentage points to around 4.5 per cent on the back of the pandemic, but as such remains fairly low. Whereas there was a more pronounced variation in the vacancy rate between the seven top locations in the past, two camps have now emerged. At 8 per cent, the vacancy rate in Dsseldorf and Frankfurt is roughly twice that of the five other loca- tions which have figures of 3 to 4 per cent. Prior to Covid, Berlin, Munich and Stuttgart had the lowest vacancy rates. Most recently, though, they have been beat- en by Cologne with a figure of 2.8 per cent.", "filename": "2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf"}, {"text": " VACANCY RATE () 20 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 2002 OFFICE SPACE COMPLETIONS IN FRANKFURT IN M 600,000 500,000 400,000 300,000 200,000 100,000 2003 2006 2009 second half year 2012 2015 2018 first half year 2021 0 1992 1997 Frankfurt 2002 2007 2012 2017 2022e average 1992-2021 Source: bulwiengesa Source: bulwiengesa 37 38 Hamburg: Office space PRIME OFFICE RENT IN EUR PER M 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 2002 2008 2005 Hamburg TAKE-UP IN HAMBURG IN M 700,000", "filename": "2022-09-21_Immobilienmarkt_Deutschland_2022_2023_EN.pdf"}, {"text": " Only one deal - involving Citibank - reached the 10,000 m2 mark.

Perhaps the biggest challenge confronting urban landlords and city leaders is what to do with all that older office space that increasingly looks redundant, obsolete, or both. One of the major problems we have in the office market right now is weve got a bunch of pre-1980 buildings that are function- ally obsolete, and we dont know what we do with them, says the global head of research for an investment management firm. The instinct of many owners will be to upgrade in order to attract new tenants. But that approach can be expensive, with the payoff highly uncertain. Owners of one older high-rise in Boston invested $300 million to convert the 1 million-square-foot con- crete building into a sleek glass-lined tower. Some major leases have been signed, but significant blocks remain available. Not every older building would require such extensive improve- ments to compete for tenants, of course, but even funding tenant improvements may be too risky in this highly competi- tive market. A senior executive with one CRE investment firm believes, Theres going to be a lot of distress. Even in a great market, if their debt is coming due, theyre going to be hard pressed to refinance that building, particularly if that building needs the capital to fit out space, get new building amenities, all the things that are required as table stakes today in leasing office space.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " Says one real estate investment banking executive, Its all going to be triggered by when major leases roll or debt matures or theres some debt extension test that comes up. Some of those buildings will come back to the lenders, but others may be can- didates for conversion to other uses. One affordable housing developer is optimistic about the poten- tial for more housing. Anybody whos sitting in city hall with a homelessness problem, which is pretty much everybody, needs to start thinking about how to take some of these office buildings and repurpose them into all flavors of residential, including some homeless shelters. But as with the aforementioned mall conversions, that would require a tremendous value decline to make such projects feasible, among other hurdles. That capitulation could be painful and really has yet to begin. Half of the industry people surveyed for Emerging Trends believe that central-city offices are over- priced. But at some point, owners may have no alternative to a serious writedown if office tenant demand keeps falling. Moving from Here to There Discussions with experienced practitioners for the upcoming ULI report, Behind the Facade: The Feasibility of Converting Commercial Real Estate to Multifamily, suggest several lessons that can increase the odds of successful conversions. First is the understanding that there is no cookie-cutter building to convert, particularly when converting commercial real estate to multifam- ily use. Not only is each experience different, but developers of successful conversions expect that each subsequent one will be different.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " Promising opportunities include residential units and newer or better- located industrial stock, as well opportunities to retrofit for the future.

That is the inescapable conclusion from our many discussions with leaders across the industry, as summarized in the preced- ing pages. There also is not enough developable land on which to build all the housing and warehouses where needed. Hmmm, maybe theres something to that. The Importance of Older Buildings In her classic 1961 urban planning treatise, The Death and Life of Great American Cities, Jane Jacobs elucidates the critical ingredients for a diverse, vibrant city. Among them is one rule that may seem puzzling at first: The district must mingle build- ings that vary in age and condition, including a good proportion of old ones. Why the need for old buildings? Why not all new? If a city area has only new buildings, the enterprises that can exist there are automatically limited to those that can support the high costs of new construction. How boring and monotonous that would be. Jacobs points to all the small local businesses that occupy these older structures that give the neighborhood its diversity and vitality.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " Although Jacobs doesnt say it precisely, there is another crucial observation regarding the importance of older buildings: so many of them find new life with uses different from their original function. Walk around the bustling old port districts of Montreal or Boston or Portland, Maine, and you will find hundreds of for- mer warehouses that have been repurposed into upscale hotels, cool offices, hip restaurants, and distinctive retail spaces. Conversions are hardly limited to old warehouse districts. Every vibrant downtown is filled with buildings of varying types and vintages that have been converted into new uses. Often the conversions go upstream, as lower-value land uses like ware- houses convert into higher-value uses like office or retail. But the direction is often reversed, with old offices converting into artist space or storage. Lemonade from Lemons Demographic trends and structural demand shifts magnified by the pandemic have rendered countless existing buildings either redundant or obsolete . But manythough not allof these can be either repurposed or upgraded to meet new market standards. The many opportunities include the following: 18  Converting older offices to residential uses, or upgrading them into modern offices, where feasible and supported by the market.  Repurposing excess retail space for other uses or improving with mixed use. And  Scraping buildings to create development land where con- version is not feasible, or where density can be increased, to site new housing.

By the end of 2021 prime rents were down by 12 per cent on 2019 to EUR 250 per m2, and have since been stagnating. To reduce the number of visible vacant properties, the Hamburg Senate has established a funding programme to enable creative businesses and start-ups to temporarily rent unused retail space.

Retrofitting for the Future The obstacles to converting from one property type to another are varied and daunting. Many owners will rise to the challenge, but such undertakings are often not practicaleither too expen- sive or just too difficult. But the need to retrofit for the future, as one real estate adviser points out, provides another set of opportunities that may be more limited in scope but ultimately broader in scale. Owners and managers of real estate will need to enhance the resilience of their assets against potential climate change impacts or otherwise decarbonize their assets as increasingly demanded by tenants, investors, and regulators, as we discuss in greater detail below.

New York has benefited from increased demand in all areas, particularly the early stages of international and business travel in the first half of 2022, followed by international and domestic leisure over the summer months. Improvement in Los Angeles was propelled by a higher concentration of luxury rooms, which were able to maintain, or even exceed, pre-pandemic rates with less price-sensitive guests.

However, it is unclear whether this shift in demand will be permanent as international destinations continue to open back up and offer alternatives for the leisure traveler. These markets significantly increased in popularity during the pandemic due to their built-in outdoor activities , which are conducive to social distancing. As international outbound travel continues to increase with domestic travelers becoming more comfortable taking bigger, longer-distance trips again, this previously built-up demand in drive-to leisure and resort destinations may be disrupted.

Yes, we think so. Japans economic recovery has lagged. The labor market improved in 2022, but is still soft relative to 2019. October inflation at 3.6 was the highest in four decades, but modest versus other countries. The pressure was also largely imported while domestic inflation stayed benign. In that context, maintaining the loose monetary policy appears the right thing to do. However, something has to give due to this diverging policy stance versus elsewhere. JPY succumbed to market forces and fell to a 32-year low as a result, putting pressure on the Bank of Japans (BoJ) decision. In reaction, the Ministry of Finance intervened in the FX market for the first time since 1998 to stabilize the currency.

In Japan, debt costs have moved far less than in other parts of the world, as inflation remains subdued and the Bank of Japan continues to exercise yield curve control . By contrast, Europes real estate yield starting point was exceptionally low and market interest rates have moved up much more markedly, making the math that much more impactful. Government policy also matters. As central banks seek to choke off inflation by tightening monetary policy, there is at least the reasonable expectation that some of that inflation will be passed into rents and thus property cash flows. But when governments employ long-term borrowing to bail out energy consumers in the short term, as is necessary in Europe, interest rates are pushed up further and the impact on property values may be more detrimental.

However, persistently high inflation has already started to affect the affordability of index-linked rental properties and office tenants that are under pressure may seek to renegotiate their leases. The European office market is characterised by a large variety of rental contracts and if rental increases are staggered, for example, inflation cannot be passed on fully. At the time of writing, there is little market evidence of repricing of privately owned prime offices, but we estimate that average- quality office values may have fallen by roughly 15 by the end of Q4 2022 since their peak at the end of 2021. This amounts to a yield expansion of about 50bps. A yield correction is also on the cards for prime offices in Europe, but the increase is likely to be more moderate. Broker reports indicate that prime yields already started to move out in some locations between Q1 2022 and Q2 2022, with German cities leading the pack at 30bps. French and Spanish cities posted quarter-on-quarter yield increases of between 15 and 25bps. As risk-free rates are up and expected to remain elevated between 2023 and 2025, we believe office capital values could soften further during the outlook period, and we estimate prime yields in Europe will move out by another 50bps.

Online retail sales as a percentage of total retail turnover currently averages 12 in Europe and this figure is expected to rise to approximately 21 by 2027. Consumer confidence, meanwhile, is at an all-time low due to sky-high inflation and declining consumer purchasing power.

The corporate and international investor community is, however, acknowledging the need for more sustainable buildings. Individual cities rather than the national government are leading the U.

In our main scenario, we therefore also assume slightly falling prime rents for the coming year. In 2024, too, the downside risk outweighs the growth opportunities for rents in view of further rising vacancy rates. This could change from 2025 onwards, because the current environment of high financing and construction costs will lead to significantly fewer project developments being started. There could then be a lack of new construction space, at least, and this could lead to rising rents in the prime segment. Logistics markets Private households and the manufacturing sector are suffering particularly from the current and foreseeable macroeconomic environment. The former are facing a massive real loss of purchasing power due to high inflation and will have to reduce their consumption. The latter will be squeezed by rising energy costs and lower global demand. If fewer goods are bought as well as produced, this puts a double burden on the demand for logistics space. After rising to record levels until recently, take-up is expected to fall in 2023. A rising number of insolvencies, especially among small and medium-sized enterprises, could also lead to higher vacancy rates in the small-space segment.

As a result, some of the space that was previously still marketable no longer meets user needs and has fallen vacant.

In that context, maintaining the loose monetary policy appears the right thing to do. However, something has to give due to this diverging policy stance versus elsewhere. JPY succumbed to market forces and fell to a 32-year low as a result, putting pressure on the Bank of Japans (BoJ) decision. In reaction, the Ministry of Finance intervened in the FX market for the first time since 1998 to stabilize the currency.

Higher yielding assets generally come from sectors with weak occupational demand, hence the risk of void periods and negative rental growth are much higher, particularly during a period of economic stress. Sectors including life sciences, student accommodation, cold storage logistics and self- storage where there are strong structural drivers to support rental growth, are expected to see the greatest value protection. This was welcome news for markets. While unlikely to change the JPY direction, we take comfort that both the government and the BoJ are on the same page. First, this helps to buy time until the US Fed softens its hawkish stance. Second, there is also a positive implication that the next BoJ governor due to be appointed in April 2023 will not deviate materially. To be clear, an exit from the ultra-loose policy is possible in the medium-term. However, it will most likely be done in a gradual manner.

In Japan, debt costs have moved far less than in other parts of the world, as inflation remains subdued and the Bank of Japan continues to exercise yield curve control . By contrast, Europes real estate yield starting point was exceptionally low and market interest rates have moved up much more markedly, making the math that much more impactful. Government policy also matters. As central banks seek to choke off inflation by tightening monetary policy, there is at least the reasonable expectation that some of that inflation will be passed into rents and thus property cash flows. But when governments employ long-term borrowing to bail out energy consumers in the short term, as is necessary in Europe, interest rates are pushed up further and the impact on property values may be more detrimental.

In Japan, yield curve control comes at the cost of a weak yen. If the Bank of Japan (BoJ) remains committed to keeping interest rates near zero, currency intervention, such as yen-buying to prevent further depreciation, could be on the table again. However, currency intervention has rarely been successful absent the cooperation from other central banks. Any changes to the yield control approach are likely to come after BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kurodas term concludes in April 2023.

China has implemented monetary easing to support the economic recovery and offset some of the negative impacts of its COVID- Zero policy. Monetary easing, combined with various supportive home purchase policies, could be the catalyst for the housing market in China to bottom. The pace of the housing market recovery will depend on the governments efforts to ensure the delivery of unfinished properties by defaulted developers and the direction of the COVID-Zero policy.

The ECB and BoE will continue to raise interest rates to defend currencies to avoid importing more inflation and to manage the inflationary effects of Europes tight labor markets. However, with core price pressures less pronounced than in the US and weaker long-term demographic drivers of inflation in Europe, it is likely that both the peak level and equilibrium rate of monetary policy will be lower in Continental Europe than in the US. Nevertheless, for the moment the repricing pressure on Europes lowest-yielding property sectors is profound. Buyers not using leverage have an opportunity to set pricing at the margin and they have been among the few active players.

Therefore, price pressures are likely to subside. However, inflation is likely to remain above the 2 target for some time. Therefore, the ECB started to reduce its nearly EUR 5,000 billion bond holdings as of March 2023. Initially, however, this is likely to raise capital market rates only slightly, as the holdings will be reduced by only EUR 15 billion per month from March to June. The ECB is therefore acting very cautiously. Consequently, the pressure on Bund yields is relatively low in our base scenario. We expect Bund yields to peak at 2.85 in the course of the year and at 2.65 at year-end. Consequently, mortgage rates are also likely to rise somewhat.

However, we do not expect a sustainable trend reversal before 2024, by which time the economy should also be picking up speed again.

Taking into account the high inflation rates, this means that rents will increase accordingly. At the same time, the reduced number of development projects will increase the demand for existing properties, therefore putting further upwards pressure on rents.

We expected retail capital values to bottom out, which they had started to, but are now likely to be impacted by weakening consumer spending. We said that property investors would no longer be able to rely on market-driven yield compression to drive returns, which has certainly proved accurate as the market adjusts to higher interest rates.

The Federal Reserve would raise rates to combat inflation through 2022, but slow rate increases as inflation normalizes.

Our expectation is that transaction activity will be below average in 2023, but start to recover in some sectors later in the year. While unleveraged buyers are not directly impacted by higher interest rates, they are also shifting their pricing and buying activity. They are adjusting their cost of capital in response to the broader capital markets, and unleveraged or low-leverage buyers are capital constrained as well. Higher interest rates have hurt the value of investors broader investment portfolios, triggering the so-called denominator effect, contributing to less competitive and less aggressive pricing for real estate.

Stubbornly high inflation The root cause of market challenges heading into 2023 is elevated inflation. The US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada have both made lowering inflation their top priority, but it remains stubbornly high in both markets. This led to policy rates increasing from effectively zero to over four percent by year end. The increase in policy rates has been mirrored in long-term rates and in real estate borrowing rates.

In the United States, 18 of single-family homes sold in the fourth quarter of 2021 were purchased by an institutional investor, the largest institutional share in more than 20 years.20 European residential investment has surged lately as well, topping 30 of total real estate deal flows through the first quarter of 2022.", "filename": "Deloitte 2023 Commercial Real Estate Outlook.pdf"}, {"text": "  The chronic undersupply of housing is the result of govern- ment policies that limit new supply or increase construction costs and is exacerbated by a labor shortage, as well as NIMBYism.

As one housing industry adviser notes, Theres a stress index about global supply chains, and those stress indices are all indicating that theyre moderating, but theyre still at very high levels. Finally, high permitting fees and utility charges and large minimum lot sizes push developers to build more expensive homes. Renters Priced Out of the Homebuying Market With a growing share of households priced out of the for-sale market, demand for rental units is far outstripping new supply.

The construction sector as a whole hasnt returned to the peak we saw prior to the Great Recession. We saw a lot of that labor leave the sector for something maybe perceived more stable, says the economist for a housing advisory firm. All these factors are conspiring to limit housing construction far below population growth. In fact, the number of single-family housing starts in the last decade (20102019) relative to house- hold formations was the lowest since the government began tracking these trends and half as much or less than in preced- ing decades, despite the consistent increase in deliveries since bottoming in 2010.

We have seen initiatives from higher levels of government to encourage faster development approvals by municipalities, new money to incentivize construction of affordable homes, and policy changes aimed at facilitating the building of modestly denser forms of housing, like duplexes, triplexes, and mid-rise buildings, in urban areas currently reserved for single-family units. While the increased acknowledgment of the supply gap is posi- tive and the initiatives in response are welcome, the actions fall have been taking on their own, with one describing efforts to make a small number of units more accessible by modifying deposit structures. One interviewee discussed their efforts to increase efficiencies by shifting certain engineering and construction activities to happen earlier in the design pro- cess. Another interviewee emphasized the need for more collaborative partnerships among industry players, nonprofit organizations, and governments to deliver affordable hous- ing. There are many examples of creative partnerships and approaches to building affordable homes in Canada that, with the right funding and incentives from governments, can make a difference if applied more broadly.

According to Statistics Canada, construction job vacancies reached a record high in the first quarter of 2022 and were double the number of open positions during the same period in 2020. And then there is the impact of construction wages, which were up 6.6 percent in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2021. All of this has made completing projects on time and on budget even harder than in the past, and the situation is unlikely to improve in the foreseeable future.

Adaptation Key as the Landscape Shifts for Canadian Real Estate What does this mean for real estate companies? For some, it adds further to the need to take a pause on activity.

So far, migra- tion from the highest-priced markets has not been enough to actually reduce housing costs in those markets, though costs generally are rising more slowly there. Demographics and the slowing economy could also help ease the housing imbalance. The nations population is growing at its slowest pace ever, thanks to both low birth and immigration rates. And fewer buyers are on the hunt for homes now due to affordability and concerns about possible job losses in a recession. The good news is that it is an opportunity for home- builders and land developers to do a little catch-up.

The End of the Beginning But there is one issue on which our interviewees agree: The exis- tential risk for the real estate economy right now is that Fed action in response to persistent inflation will tip us into a recession, says a senior partner with a leading advisory firm. But can the Federal Reserve Bank tame inflation without breaking the economy? Moderating inflation rates this summer led many to believe that the worst was over and that the Fed could soon ease up its con- tractionary monetary policy. Indeed, the consensus of experts we interviewed this summer was that the Fed would cease tightening by the end of 2022 and start cutting rates again in mid-2023. That sentiment now appears optimistic. Inflation is going to be a little stickier than people think, said an investment banking executive we interviewed during the summer, whose views turned out to be more prescient. Sentiment started changing in late August when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell gave his annual speech to fellow central bankers affirming the Fed view that infla- tion is not nearly under control, jolting markets. Any remaining doubt about that was quashed by the official Fed commentary accompanying their September rate announcement projecting that rates would keep rising through 2023.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " The surge continued into 2022, with sales volumes in the first half of the year up 38 percent over the same period last year, as even the sharp rise in interest rates did little to dampen transaction volumes.

Discussions with numerous participants from all corners of the industry confirm that many investors have moved to the sidelinesor to other types of assets like equities and bonds. Indeed, the recent surge may well reflect a last gasp to get deals done before the expected increase in interest rates. Fewer Investors Fewer investors and lenders will be providing capital for assets, according to this years Emerging Trends survey: expectations of availability declined for every one of the 13 equity and debt capital sources. Over the past decade, CRE markets benefited from a substantial capital inflow as alternative investment classes have gained wider acceptance and real estate offered compel- ling risk-adjusted returns. Now, some of those inflows look to reverse. Investor interest is still healthy, but not what it was. Instead of seven or 10 competing offers for sale, theres now two or three, which I think thats normal, says the head of an investment firm. Thats normalizing, too.

Total returns for the institutional-quality real estate in the NCREIF Property Index (NPI) soared to over 20 percent in the four quarters through mid-2022, almost three times the 20-year average. But returns will be coming down. The 43 economists and ana- lysts surveyed in October 2022 by ULIs Center for Real Estate Economics and Capital Markets expect total returns to drop to 3.8 percent in 2023, and recover to a moderate 7 percent in 2024. That is to say, more normal returns. That outlook tracks with the collective wisdom of respondents to this years Emerging Trends survey. More than half believe that capitalization rates are heading up next year and returns are coming down, primarily due to rising interest rates and cost of capital, which was the top economic concern voiced in our survey. After more than a decade of lower for longer, the Fed is finally normalizing interest rates closer to historical levels. Those rising interest rates are already driving up debt costs and thus the costs to acquire and develop property, reducing leveraged returns.

In an August 2022 survey by the National Association of Business Economics, only a quarter of economists were even somewhat confident that the Fed could bring down inflation to its target range without causing a recession. Worrying signs out of Europe in early autumn and expectations of soaring heating bills this coming winter add to the gloomy global economic outlook. These conditions would be problematic for property markets: slowing or falling economic growth dampens tenant demand, while higher interest rates raise the cost of developing or acquiring properties. Both factors would cut returns and reduce values. Indeed, rising interest rates and uncertainty over future market conditions are already killing deals since sellers have not been ready to capitulate to buyers growing demands for price concessions, as we discuss in our capital markets trend.

Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs. We have already started to see cap rates and yields rise in many markets, with the most rapid adjustment taking place in the UK. However, we do not think that prices fully reflect higher interest rates yet. To assess when values might bottom out, we can look to past downturns and the listed market for guidance. In the Global Financial Crisis, for example, global capital values bottomed out in 4Q09, while GDP across global real estate markets troughed three quarters earlier, in 1Q09, as did global listed real estate prices1. Market downturns usually present opportunities, and one we expect for investors in 2023 is a correction in pricing as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. Although we do not expect large amounts of distress in the market, we do expect some, already apparent in parts of the UK market. This should allow investors access to assets at attractive pricing. The early 1990s downturn was longer, with US capital values continuing to decline into 1995.

The steep turnaround in interest rates triggered a price correction on the real estate markets from the spring onwards, whereby the uncertainty about the extent and duration of the correction led to many investors temporarily withdrawing from the market. The turnaround in interest rates now appears to be largely complete and on this basis, we believe that a reliable price level should re-emerge on the real estate markets in the course of 2023, possibly as early as the spring.

As a result, mortgage rates should also fall again, uncertainty among investors should decrease noticeably and the positive price drivers should take over. In many respects, the historical model for current developments is the 1970s. Then, too, there were energy crises, high wage settlements, loose fiscal policy, and wars. In that decade average inflation increased by 5 annually and house prices by 6. If by 2030 house prices were again to increase at 1 point above inflation, and assuming an average inflation rate of 3 annually, then house prices would increase by 4 annually.

All these factors are conspiring to limit housing construction far below population growth.

While the increased acknowledgment of the supply gap is posi- tive and the initiatives in response are welcome, the actions fall have been taking on their own, with one describing efforts to make a small number of units more accessible by modifying deposit structures. One interviewee discussed their efforts to increase efficiencies by shifting certain engineering and construction activities to happen earlier in the design pro- cess. Another interviewee emphasized the need for more collaborative partnerships among industry players, nonprofit organizations, and governments to deliver affordable hous- ing. There are many examples of creative partnerships and approaches to building affordable homes in Canada that, with the right funding and incentives from governments, can make a difference if applied more broadly.

Most notable are different approaches to prefabricated and modular housing in which much or all of the house is built in a factory and then assembled on the homesite. These methods can dramatically reduce the need for labor and shrink production times at more affordable costs. Promising innovations are also arising from the nascent single-fam- ily build-to-rent sector, which is learning how to scale construction and design to reduce costs and development time, as explained in our single-family sector overview found in chapter 2. Government could also expand affordable housing produc- tion. Unfortunately, Congress dropped the affordable housing components of the proposed Build Back Better Act from what became the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, meaning that no additional federal help is on the way. But many state and local governments are stepping into the breach, as we discuss in our final trend on regulation. In the end, perhaps the most effective solution is the most obvi- ous: we must construct more housing that is affordable to more people.

The Future of Single-Family Housing The early 2020s have been a transformative time for the housing industry as the pandemic caused people around the world to reevaluate both where they live and how they live. The United States experienced the Great American Move in which house- holds and businesses relocated to more affordable places, often to buy or rent a home with additional space and a yard, and farther from employment centers. Builders across the country could not keep up with the new demandand supply chain interruptions, labor shortages, and permitting delays during the COVID-19 pandemic did not help matters. As a result, home prices escalated at historic rates. The median new home price in the United States increased 22 percent since the start of 2020 and existing home prices increased 58 percent. 45 Today, the single-family housing industry is on the other side of the rapid run-up in demand and pricesinflation and the rapid escalation of mortgage rates have resulted in a cooldown of the for-sale housing market.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " Further boosting demand is the increasing number of younger adults choosing to live alone, according The multifamily sector has responded with an unprecedented increase in new supply.

Vacancies have fallen to their lowest levels ever while rents are rising faster than evereven faster than home prices. And though not a formal part of the affordability calculations, other housing-related costs like utilities and main- tenance are also rising faster than incomes, further constraining the ability of households to afford basic shelter.

Existing rents could also show a higher dynamic in future than in the past. For example, the difference between new leases and existing rents widened in the boom, which could increase the pressure. In addition, rents for index-linked leases rose automatically due to high inflation. Their share of all leases is likely to be small, but due to the bottlenecks analysed below, landlords are likely to be able to enforce them increasingly. Politicians are discussing capping index-linked rents. However, this discussion has only recently flared up, and there is no agreement on this in the coalition agreement. According to consumer price statistics, existing rents in March 2023 were already up 2.0 on the previous year, the highest figure since 1998 . In addition, the share of short-term rentals and furnished apartments that are not regulated by rent brakes and caps is increasing, which means that rents can rise more strongly.

UBS Asset Management Weve narrowed it down to A year ago, the world remained in the grips of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Omicron variant had just emerged. 12 months on and the pandemic has largely subsided, only to be replaced by a brutal war in Ukraine and inflation reaching multi-decade highs. This prompted central banks to make aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022, with more expected in 2023, along with a mild recession in the economy. Looking back to our 2022 predictions, in general they proved prescient. We expected hybrid working to weigh on the office market and that the polarization between the best and worst assets would continue, which has been the case. We expected retail capital values to bottom out, which they had started to, but are now likely to be impacted by weakening consumer spending. We said that property investors would no longer be able to rely on market-driven yield compression to drive returns, which has certainly proved accurate as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. In 2023, the environment for real estate looks set to be more challenging, with headwinds coming both from higher interest rates and a weaker economy, which will impact on occupier demand.

Inflation would remain high through 2022, but gradually settle around 2 by mid-2023 as demand for goods subsides in favor of services, helping businesses alleviate supply chain issues. The Federal Reserve would raise rates to combat inflation through 2022, but slow rate increases as inflation normalizes. Other, less likely scenarios include: (1) Back to the 1970s (25) where businesses raise prices and wages in lockstep and there is sustained high inflation. (2) COVID-19 relapse (5) in which vaccines become ineffective, and lockdowns are again imposed. And (3) Next recession (15), triggered by overly aggressive tightening of monetary policy as governments attempt to tame inflation. Regardless of which scenario comes to fruition, the 2023 Deloitte real estate outlook survey reveals that concerns about the economy are top of mind for most global real estate leaders as they prepare for the remainder of 2022 and 2023 .

Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs. We have already started to see cap rates and yields rise in many markets, with the most rapid adjustment taking place in the UK. However, we do not think that prices fully reflect higher interest rates yet. To assess when values might bottom out, we can look to past downturns and the listed market for guidance. In the Global Financial Crisis, for example, global capital values bottomed out in 4Q09, while GDP across global real estate markets troughed three quarters earlier, in 1Q09, as did global listed real estate prices1. Market downturns usually present opportunities, and one we expect for investors in 2023 is a correction in pricing as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. Although we do not expect large amounts of distress in the market, we do expect some, already apparent in parts of the UK market. This should allow investors access to assets at attractive pricing. The early 1990s downturn was longer, with US capital values continuing to decline into 1995.

In such situations, sellers may be willing to accept below-market prices, or indeed have to, in order to facilitate a sale. For investors wanting to deploy capital now, holding off for a few months as pricing adjusts is probably the best strategy. Given the higher interest rate environment, we also think that floating rate real estate debt is an attractive way to achieve strong inflation protected returns and generate a good income return from real estate. Finally, looking across the globe, another potential opportunity for investors in 2023 is Japan, due to accretive hedging gains for investment into this market. Indeed, investors need to be mindful of large differences in monetary policy as interest rate differentials between countries determine the cost of hedging. Currently, Japan is particularly attractive on an after-hedging basis, since interest rates there are lower than in other markets. Page 3 of 8 What opportunities exist for investors in 2023?

Our expectation is that transaction activity will be below average in 2023, but start to recover in some sectors later in the year. While unleveraged buyers are not directly impacted by higher interest rates, they are also shifting their pricing and buying activity. They are adjusting their cost of capital in response to the broader capital markets, and unleveraged or low-leverage buyers are capital constrained as well.

But with supply also constrained and getting even tighter in the rental market, rising rents are adding to the growing affordability crisis. While the RBCs report noted that worsening affordability condi- tions would be particularly marked in relatively high-priced markets like Toronto and Vancouver, the challenges have been spreading across Canada as Canadians increasingly move to other communitieslike suburbs and evolving 18-hour cities as well as small towns and rural areasin search of cheaper places to live. Migration away from Canadas largest cities which still tend to see population increases as a result of high rates of international immigrationhas been a trend for some time, but the growth of remote working during the pandemic has exacerbated the move outwards and helped make affordability pressures more widespread. We can see the impacts in annual population estimates published earlier in 2022 from Statistics Canada. The findings, which cover annual population changes as of July 1, 2021, include the following:  Toronto and Montreal saw the largest net migration losses to other regions of Ontario and Quebec, respectively, since at least 20012002.  Net intraprovincial migration to rural areas increased across Canada.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " Historically, affordability has played a key role in housing pur- chase decisions, and the rise in home prices along with higher mortgage rates has brought affordability to the forefront. Over 67 percent of households who rent cite the lack of a down payment as the biggest hurdle to homeownership. Builders have always struggled to provide affordable housing, but the rise in the cost of materials over the past two years has impeded any progress. However, some builders are starting to report lower costs especially laboras the market cools.

Most of those funds eventually just went away or changed their focus. Investors waiting for distressed deals in the coming years may be similarly disappointed. The research head of one investment management firm says, A lot of bids have gone away, highly leveraged bids have gone away, but theres still a lot of depth to the capital markets. A lot of the nontraded REITs have plenty of money. Theres still high net worth. The strength of the U. S. dollar, while its going up, also confirms that foreigners like to own U. S. dollar assets. So, theres plenty of liquidity. A pension fund portfolio manager adds, We have pulled back on some things. Were more selective, and things have to be more compelling. You have to take a closer look, resharpen your pencils. But deals will get done. Concludes one adviser, If deals underwrite and make sense, there is capital that is both eager and available. 4.

One developer says, The average deal for us used to take 90 days to close, and now its over six months. Some experts we interviewed believe that the rise of single- family rentals (SFRs) also contributes to declining affordability of for-sale housing. Proponents argue that SFRs extend the opportunity to live in a single-family house to those who cannot afford to buy or just dont want to, while generally expanding the supply of rental housing. But critics point out that institutional capital is driving up prices in the resale market, in the words of one housing adviser, by outbidding owneroccupant homebuy- ers for existing homes. One reason: existing tax laws are stacked against the individual homebuyer. Explains one academic, Investors are allowed to not only deduct everything, but also they can depreciate the unit. They also have access to lower cost of capital. In sum, institutional buyers assembling horizontal apartment portfolios can afford to pay more to be the high bidder for homes. And they do.

This is a difficult question to answer given the many risk factors. Trends triggered by the Covid pandemic, such as working from home (WFH), and the boom in online shopping, continue to have an impact. Added to these are the economic impact and uncertainty following Russias invasion of Ukraine. The real estate sector is facing a skills shortage, supply chain problems and rapidly rising costs for new construction and renovation. Rising capital market yields are driving up property financing costs and the returns expected by real estate investors. The ECB also contribu- ted to this with two strong key interest rate increases in July and September 2022.  This is not making decisions to invest in the real estate market any easier, alt- hough with initial rental yields clearly outperforming bond yields, property remains an interesting class. This 15th issue of our market report provides in- formation on how to assess the property market. We once again review the commercial real estate markets of the seven largest German cities  the top lo- cations of Berlin, Cologne, Dsseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich and Stuttgart.

Today, with more than one out of three of Americas 44 million renter households earning less than $36,000 a year, roughly every other rental household puts more than 30 percent of their earnings toward rent. And one out of every four households spends 50 percent or more of their wages on housing. Those percentages reflect divides that deepen because not enough new apartment units are coming online. A present that is polarized grows more so over time. For market- rate property investors, developers, owners, and managers, what lies ahead is the brightest beacon of prosperity. But for those who live and reside below the cutline of wherewithal and social mobility, the future of apartment rentals holds more ques- tions than answers. With 1.3 million new U.

In addition, it casts a new cloud of uncertainty over the near-term outlook for market-rate residential investment. The Push and Pull of Trends: Rentership Rising Broad-stroke household demographics point irrefutably to strong secular demand for multifamily rental apartment development. During the 2022-to-2035 stretch that lies ahead, 275 million adults the total of all the adult-aged generational cohortswill continue to make shelter decisions, especially as U. S. domes- tic migration and mobility continues at over 27 million movers each year. Financial factorsgiven that runaway costs and high mortgage interest rates will price more households out of homeownership as an optionwill determine many of their decisions, as has long been the case. What is different over the past several years has been growth in discretionary rental households, also known as rent-by-choice households. According to Harvards Joint Center for Housing Studies (JCHS), the number of renters making at least $75,000 jumped by 48 percent over the decade ending just before the pandemic, to 11.3 million.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " 36 growth spiraled upward nationally in ranges from just under 10 percent to just shy of 25 percent. The Pandemic: This Time Is Different With the pandemic and the cascade of economic and social policies it set off, five macro apartment industry tailwinds reached gale-force levels:  One, there was a preexisting multigenerational avalanche of both rent-by-choice and rent-by-necessity demand for multifamily rental units.  Two, demand gathered speed and sweep as people sought larger living spaces to balance remote work and household life, and more outdoor living options.  Three, constrained construction of new supply, and a price run-up on the single-family for-sale front, spilled over into expanded apartment demand.  Lastly, compounding the effects of these four dramatic imbalances came the rocket fuel of a global capital rotation toward de-risked assets . Outsized demand, a sudden spike in remote work mobility, constricted supply, and floods of money with nowhere better to goa grand slam of anomalies. The U. S. apartment property sectorproviding shelter to 37 mil- lion residents in 21.3 million structures of five or more household units, and contributing $3.4 trillion annually to the U.

The Future of Single-Family Housing The early 2020s have been a transformative time for the housing industry as the pandemic caused people around the world to reevaluate both where they live and how they live. The United States experienced the Great American Move in which house- holds and businesses relocated to more affordable places, often to buy or rent a home with additional space and a yard, and farther from employment centers. Builders across the country could not keep up with the new demandand supply chain interruptions, labor shortages, and permitting delays during the COVID-19 pandemic did not help matters. As a result, home prices escalated at historic rates. The median new home price in the United States increased 22 percent since the start of 2020 and existing home prices increased 58 percent. 45 Today, the single-family housing industry is on the other side of the rapid run-up in demand and pricesinflation and the rapid escalation of mortgage rates have resulted in a cooldown of the for-sale housing market.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " And while multifamily vacancies are at their lowest level in four decades and rents continue to log new records every month, the rates of increase have been slowing and are expected to decelerate further, according to many experts we interviewed.

They should come back to more of a long-term historical average of 3 percent to 4 percent, and maybe offset some of the unafford- ability in the country.

The End of the Beginning But there is one issue on which our interviewees agree: The exis- tential risk for the real estate economy right now is that Fed action in response to persistent inflation will tip us into a recession, says a senior partner with a leading advisory firm. But can the Federal Reserve Bank tame inflation without breaking the economy? Moderating inflation rates this summer led many to believe that the worst was over and that the Fed could soon ease up its con- tractionary monetary policy. Indeed, the consensus of experts we interviewed this summer was that the Fed would cease tightening by the end of 2022 and start cutting rates again in mid-2023. That sentiment now appears optimistic. Inflation is going to be a little stickier than people think, said an investment banking executive we interviewed during the summer, whose views turned out to be more prescient. Sentiment started changing in late August when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell gave his annual speech to fellow central bankers affirming the Fed view that infla- tion is not nearly under control, jolting markets. Any remaining doubt about that was quashed by the official Fed commentary accompanying their September rate announcement projecting that rates would keep rising through 2023.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " As Winston Churchill famously cautioned after the British army won a critical WWII battle, the victory marked not the end, not even the beginning of the end, but, possibly, the end of the beginning. 4 Higher for Longer With interest rates headed higher for longer, the risk of a deeper, full-fledged recession is rising, according to a grow- ing consensus of economists. In an August 2022 survey by the National Association of Business Economics, only a quarter of economists were even somewhat confident that the Fed could bring down inflation to its target range without causing a recession. Worrying signs out of Europe in early autumn and expectations of soaring heating bills this coming winter add to the gloomy global economic outlook. These conditions would be problematic for property markets: slowing or falling economic growth dampens tenant demand, while higher interest rates raise the cost of developing or acquiring properties. Both factors would cut returns and reduce values. Indeed, rising interest rates and uncertainty over future market conditions are already killing deals since sellers have not been ready to capitulate to buyers growing demands for price concessions, as we discuss in our capital markets trend.

We are reluctant to make investment decisions based solely on a view of future interest rates, but acknowledge that real estate pricing is linked to future interest rates. Given this dynamic, we recommend investors consider a range of interest rate scenarios . Interest rate increases and the relentless math Each time interest rates ticked higher since the GFC, the question of when higher debt costs would impact real estate values was asked. It was a speculative question, with the underlying assumption that rate increases thus far had not yet impacted values. Regardless of the answer then, it became very clear in 2022 that the relentless math of higher borrowing rates was having an impact on leveraged returns and asset values . The boost investors were getting from borrowing has shifted to a drag on a cash basis, but with unleveraged internal rates of return generally above borrowing rates, leverage is still marginally accretive on a total return basis. However, with less lift from borrowing, leveraged buyers are largely out of the market . Higher borrowing rates are a function of both higher indices and increased borrowing spreads. Lending volume is down significantly and lenders are becoming more conservative. The supply of debt capital from large money center banks is down due to large positions taken in the first half of 2022 coupled with stress testing.", "filename": "isa-outlook-2023.pdf"}, {"text": "4 How can investors respond to these developments? The following consequences are likely to result from an environment with structurally high inflation, a tendency toward somewhat higher nominal interest rates and negative real interest rates. First, prices will probably remain under pressure until the end of the interest rate hikes. Second, highly leveraged projects are significantly riskier than in the past decade, which should put the brakes on risk-taking investors. This scenario would therefore continue to allow risk-averse, long-term investors to achieve decent returns. 4.5 Risk scenario for 2023 and later: Structurally high inflation There are two main reasons why inflation could continue to spike upward. First, tax revenues bubble up when inflation rates are high. This allows for a very loose fiscal policy and boosts inflation, again. Second, a labor market in full employment and an acute shortage of labor and skilled workers raises wages. This is particularly true due to the impending wave of retirements, which is likely to increase demand for workers. Strong interest rate hikes increase the risk of recession and the risks to financial market stability. Therefore, central banks may tend to raise interest rates only tentatively. However, the history from the 1970s and the interest rate shock in the early 1980s teaches us that when inflation is structurally high, these risks are eventually accepted in order to bring inflation back under control.

However, this will only persist if high inflation eases again and falls below the 2 target. Otherwise, there is a threat of further interest rate tightening. In the short term, the current high uncertainty and financial stability risks are likely to limit the potential for interest rate hikes.

For example, inflation in the 1970s ended with the Volcker shock and massive interest rate hikes. These led not only to a severe recession, but also to the Latin American crisis. So if inflation remains structurally high, sooner or later interest rates could rise again sharply. House prices could then come under renewed pressure. In this scenario, however, almost all investments are likely to lose value, and investments in the German housing market could still perform relatively well compared with other asset classes.

A year ago, key uncertainties surrounding our predictions for moving beyond the acute pandemic phase were around issues like new COVID variants and booster deployment. As for todays economic situation, key uncertainties include:  How long will it take for inflation to come under control? How high must interest rates go in the meantime? There have recently been signs that inflation is peaking, but such hopes could prove fleeting.  How severe an economic slowdown will be required to stabilize in inflation? Will the downturn be steep or shallow? Long or short in duration?  Longer term, will inflation become endemic, remaining sticky at a higher level than observed in recent decades?

China has implemented monetary easing to support the economic recovery and offset some of the negative impacts of its COVID- Zero policy. Monetary easing, combined with various supportive home purchase policies, could be the catalyst for the housing market in China to bottom. The pace of the housing market recovery will depend on the governments efforts to ensure the delivery of unfinished properties by defaulted developers and the direction of the COVID-Zero policy.

The United States experienced the Great American Move in which house- holds and businesses relocated to more affordable places, often to buy or rent a home with additional space and a yard, and farther from employment centers. Builders across the country could not keep up with the new demandand supply chain interruptions, labor shortages, and permitting delays during the COVID-19 pandemic did not help matters. As a result, home prices escalated at historic rates.

Bottom formation will be near if interest rate rises end soon We expect prices to fall by a further 2 in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter.

The starting signal for this could be more cautious communication by the ECB with regard to further interest rate hikes and a continued cautious approach to reducing bond purchases. As a result, mortgage rates should also fall again, uncertainty among investors should decrease noticeably and the positive price drivers should take over. In many respects, the historical model for current developments is the 1970s. Then, too, there were energy crises, high wage settlements, loose fiscal policy, and wars. In that decade average inflation increased by 5 annually and house prices by 6. If by 2030 house prices were again to increase at 1 point above inflation, and assuming an average inflation rate of 3 annually, then house prices would increase by 4 annually. Rental growth is expected to be similar, so initial rental yields would run sideways at today's levels. In this scenario, rental yields remain at their current level of 3.7. The housing market would remain attractive in this scenario, but in addition to the higher financing costs, refurbishment costs, CO2 levies and the like would have to be paid from the yields.

Economists point to elevated vulnerabilities in global housing markets and a risk of a sudden price reversal if financial conditions were to tighten significantly.23 However, some fundamental forces can help explain why pricing appreciation may endure, albeit slower than the recent torrid pace: better homeowner financial stability and lasting supply constraints. Compared to the rampant development of subprime markets prior to 2008, tighter credit standards today have built a stable foundation for longer-term fixed-rate mortgages. Global markets such as Germany and the United Kingdom have also increasingly adopted this mortgage structure.24 And prices continue to be propped up as the housing market remains woefully undersupplied, exacerbated by pandemic-related construction delays, shortages of materials and labor, and supply chain bottlenecks.25 In the United States, housing specialists dont foresee average global home prices falling over the coming year, but pockets in the most overvalued regions could experience corrections, especially if local governments intervene.26 Deleveraging initiatives by the government in China Mainland, for instance, have slowed investment and prices have slumped.27 Deloittes baseline economic forecast still expects house prices to rise faster than inflation,28 at least in the United States.

Buyers and sellers gradually adjust price expectations, and transaction activity slows during this process. This is the situation we see moving into 2023, in the wake of aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 as inflation hit multi-decade highs. We have already started to see cap rates and yields rise in many markets, with the most rapid adjustment taking place in the UK. However, we do not think that prices fully reflect higher interest rates yet. To assess when values might bottom out, we can look to past downturns and the listed market for guidance. In the Global Financial Crisis, for example, global capital values bottomed out in 4Q09, while GDP across global real estate markets troughed three quarters earlier, in 1Q09, as did global listed real estate prices1. Market downturns usually present opportunities, and one we expect for investors in 2023 is a correction in pricing as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. Although we do not expect large amounts of distress in the market, we do expect some, already apparent in parts of the UK market. This should allow investors access to assets at attractive pricing.

Today, with more than one out of three of Americas 44 million renter households earning less than $36,000 a year, roughly every other rental household puts more than 30 percent of their earnings toward rent. And one out of every four households spends 50 percent or more of their wages on housing. Those percentages reflect divides that deepen because not enough new apartment units are coming online. A present that is polarized grows more so over time. For market- rate property investors, developers, owners, and managers, what lies ahead is the brightest beacon of prosperity.

The Pandemic: This Time Is Different With the pandemic and the cascade of economic and social policies it set off, five macro apartment industry tailwinds reached gale-force levels:  One, there was a preexisting multigenerational avalanche of both rent-by-choice and rent-by-necessity demand for multifamily rental units.  Two, demand gathered speed and sweep as people sought larger living spaces to balance remote work and household life, and more outdoor living options.  Three, constrained construction of new supply, and a price run-up on the single-family for-sale front, spilled over into expanded apartment demand.  Lastly, compounding the effects of these four dramatic imbalances came the rocket fuel of a global capital rotation toward de-risked assets .

The Future of Single-Family Housing The early 2020s have been a transformative time for the housing industry as the pandemic caused people around the world to reevaluate both where they live and how they live. The United States experienced the Great American Move in which house- holds and businesses relocated to more affordable places, often to buy or rent a home with additional space and a yard, and farther from employment centers. Builders across the country could not keep up with the new demandand supply chain interruptions, labor shortages, and permitting delays during the COVID-19 pandemic did not help matters. As a result, home prices escalated at historic rates. The median new home price in the United States increased 22 percent since the start of 2020 and existing home prices increased 58 percent. 45 Today, the single-family housing industry is on the other side of the rapid run-up in demand and pricesinflation and the rapid escalation of mortgage rates have resulted in a cooldown of the for-sale housing market.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": "8  Four, construction capacity to add new supply stalled as COVID aftershocks played out.

The past year has recently seen record surges in housing prices globally, boosted by changes in household living and working patterns, supply and material shortages, and pandemic-era government incentives. Global home prices across 56 countries worldwide increased by as much as 10 through March 2022,16 with home prices in major cities growing by up to 12, the fastest pace since 2004.17 Pricing growth in North America (19) has outpaced Europe (12) and AP (6).18 However, increasing mortgage rates and limited supply have begun to slow home sales in the United States, which declined by 17 from January through May.19 Price increases have also drawn numerous investors into the residential rental sector. In the United States, 18 of single-family homes sold in the fourth quarter of 2021 were purchased by an institutional investor, the largest institutional share in more than 20 years.20 European residential investment has surged lately as well, topping 30 of total real estate deal flows through the first quarter of 2022.", "filename": "Deloitte 2023 Commercial Real Estate Outlook.pdf"}, {"text": " According to the vdp, new contract rents for multi-family homes rose by around 6  year-on-year in the fourth quarter both in the major cities and nationwide, the highest increase since the start of the series in 2004. Existing rents could also show a higher dynamic in future than in the past. For example, the difference between new leases and existing rents widened in the boom, which could increase the pressure. In addition, rents for index-linked leases rose automatically due to high inflation. Their share of all leases is likely to be small, but due to the bottlenecks analysed below, landlords are likely to be able to enforce them increasingly. Politicians are discussing capping index-linked rents. However, this discussion has only recently flared up, and there is no agreement on this in the coalition agreement. According to consumer price statistics, existing rents in March 2023 were already up 2.0 on the previous year, the highest figure since 1998 . In addition, the share of short-term rentals and furnished apartments that are not regulated by rent brakes and caps is increasing, which means that rents can rise more strongly. We therefore believe it is likely that existing rents could rise strongly on a sustained basis, at least if inflation remains structurally high. 2.", "filename": "2023_Housing_market_outlook__Price_dip_and_interes.pdf"}, {"text": " Annual New Supply of Student Housing, Fall 2014Fall 2022 New beds delivered Historical average since 2014: 50,306 Fall 2014 Fall 2015 Fall 2016 Fall 2017 Fall 2018 Fall 2019 Fall 2020 Fall 2021 Fall 2022 Source: RealPage Market Analytics.

In an August 2022 survey by the National Association of Business Economics, only a quarter of economists were even somewhat confident that the Fed could bring down inflation to its target range without causing a recession. Worrying signs out of Europe in early autumn and expectations of soaring heating bills this coming winter add to the gloomy global economic outlook. These conditions would be problematic for property markets: slowing or falling economic growth dampens tenant demand, while higher interest rates raise the cost of developing or acquiring properties. Both factors would cut returns and reduce values. Indeed, rising interest rates and uncertainty over future market conditions are already killing deals since sellers have not been ready to capitulate to buyers growing demands for price concessions, as we discuss in our capital markets trend.

Global home prices across 56 countries worldwide increased by as much as 10 through March 2022,16 with home prices in major cities growing by up to 12, the fastest pace since 2004.17 Pricing growth in North America (19) has outpaced Europe (12) and AP (6).18 However, increasing mortgage rates and limited supply have begun to slow home sales in the United States, which declined by 17 from January through May.19 Price increases have also drawn numerous investors into the residential rental sector. In the United States, 18 of single-family homes sold in the fourth quarter of 2021 were purchased by an institutional investor, the largest institutional share in more than 20 years.20 European residential investment has surged lately as well, topping 30 of total real estate deal flows through the first quarter of 2022.", "filename": "Deloitte 2023 Commercial Real Estate Outlook.pdf"}, {"text": "6 percent on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter of 2022. For nonresidential construction, cost increases were lower but still significant at 12.8 percent. Construction cost increases continued into the second quarter of 2022 amid inflationary pressures throughout the economy. Rising labor shortages are exacerbating the challenges. According to Statistics Canada, construction job vacancies reached a record high in the first quarter of 2022 and were double the number of open positions during the same period in 2020. And then there is the impact of construction wages, which were up 6.6 percent in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2021. All of this has made completing projects on time and on budget even harder than in the past, and the situation is unlikely to improve in the foreseeable future. The shortage of trades labor is not expected to get better any time soon and construction technologies have yet to evolve to make up the difference in cost or productivity. Adaptation Key as the Landscape Shifts for Canadian Real Estate What does this mean for real estate companies? For some, it adds further to the need to take a pause on activity. There have been rising projections, for example, of developers delaying or potentially canceling condo projects as it becomes harder to make the numbers work in these challenging conditions. Others are trying to manage this by spacing out advanced sales of new housing units to ensure that prices reflect rising costs as a project moves forward.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " For now, delays in new supply and elevated pre-leasing are keeping oversupply risk in check.

Higher-barrier locations, on the other hand, may sustain higher rent growth for longer. Construction Is Battling Supply Chain Issues Real estate developers across the United States are confronting rising construction costs. Steel, concrete, and roofing materials contribute up to 80 percent of typical shell costs. Market price surges since the end of 2019 for these, and other major catego- ries, caused finished construction costs to spike by 50 percent. Construction durations in the broader industry have increased by two to three months, on average, since 2019, due to lon- ger material lead times and increasing contractor backlogs, according to a construction director at a large industrial owner. Advanced material procurement strategies and construction technology can resolve some ongoing construction issues. Developers are moving upstream in the value chain by lever- aging direct partnerships with national material suppliers to pre-secure and prioritize long-lead building materials and mitigate material shortages where possible. Developers are also introducing modularized construction systems to expedite repeatable project elements, such as office tenant improve- ments and in-warehouse restrooms, which reduce on-site construction timelines.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": "4 Pure cost of delay Cost of land dedicated to the government or left unbuilt Complying with OSHAother labor regulations Affordability mandates Cost of applying for zoning approval Fees charged when building construction is authorized Development requirements beyond the ordinary 8.5 Costs when site work begins 11.1 Changes to building codes over the past 10 years Sources: National Association of Home Builders.

As one housing industry adviser notes, Theres a stress index about global supply chains, and those stress indices are all indicating that theyre moderating, but theyre still at very high levels. Finally, high permitting fees and utility charges and large minimum lot sizes push developers to build more expensive homes. Renters Priced Out of the Homebuying Market With a growing share of households priced out of the for-sale market, demand for rental units is far outstripping new supply.

The construction sector as a whole hasnt returned to the peak we saw prior to the Great Recession. We saw a lot of that labor leave the sector for something maybe perceived more stable, says the economist for a housing advisory firm. All these factors are conspiring to limit housing construction far below population growth. In fact, the number of single-family housing starts in the last decade (20102019) relative to house- hold formations was the lowest since the government began tracking these trends and half as much or less than in preced- ing decades, despite the consistent increase in deliveries since bottoming in 2010.

While the increased acknowledgment of the supply gap is posi- tive and the initiatives in response are welcome, the actions fall have been taking on their own, with one describing efforts to make a small number of units more accessible by modifying deposit structures. One interviewee discussed their efforts to increase efficiencies by shifting certain engineering and construction activities to happen earlier in the design pro- cess. Another interviewee emphasized the need for more collaborative partnerships among industry players, nonprofit organizations, and governments to deliver affordable hous- ing. There are many examples of creative partnerships and approaches to building affordable homes in Canada that, with the right funding and incentives from governments, can make a difference if applied more broadly.

Retail markets Even more than two and a half years after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, sales in the brick-and-mortar retail trade are still below the previously achieved level. In view of the massive loss of real purchasing power of private households, this is not likely to change in 2023.

Our expectation is that transaction activity will be below average in 2023, but start to recover in some sectors later in the year. While unleveraged buyers are not directly impacted by higher interest rates, they are also shifting their pricing and buying activity. They are adjusting their cost of capital in response to the broader capital markets, and unleveraged or low-leverage buyers are capital constrained as well.

In an August 2022 survey by the National Association of Business Economics, only a quarter of economists were even somewhat confident that the Fed could bring down inflation to its target range without causing a recession. Worrying signs out of Europe in early autumn and expectations of soaring heating bills this coming winter add to the gloomy global economic outlook. These conditions would be problematic for property markets: slowing or falling economic growth dampens tenant demand, while higher interest rates raise the cost of developing or acquiring properties. Both factors would cut returns and reduce values. Indeed, rising interest rates and uncertainty over future market conditions are already killing deals since sellers have not been ready to capitulate to buyers growing demands for price concessions, as we discuss in our capital markets trend.

Interest rate increases and the relentless math Each time interest rates ticked higher since the GFC, the question of when higher debt costs would impact real estate values was asked. It was a speculative question, with the underlying assumption that rate increases thus far had not yet impacted values. Regardless of the answer then, it became very clear in 2022 that the relentless math of higher borrowing rates was having an impact on leveraged returns and asset values . The boost investors were getting from borrowing has shifted to a drag on a cash basis, but with unleveraged internal rates of return generally above borrowing rates, leverage is still marginally accretive on a total return basis. However, with less lift from borrowing, leveraged buyers are largely out of the market . Higher borrowing rates are a function of both higher indices and increased borrowing spreads. Lending volume is down significantly and lenders are becoming more conservative. The supply of debt capital from large money center banks is down due to large positions taken in the first half of 2022 coupled with stress testing.", "filename": "isa-outlook-2023.pdf"}, {"text": "4 How can investors respond to these developments? The following consequences are likely to result from an environment with structurally high inflation, a tendency toward somewhat higher nominal interest rates and negative real interest rates. First, prices will probably remain under pressure until the end of the interest rate hikes. Second, highly leveraged projects are significantly riskier than in the past decade, which should put the brakes on risk-taking investors. This scenario would therefore continue to allow risk-averse, long-term investors to achieve decent returns. 4.5 Risk scenario for 2023 and later: Structurally high inflation There are two main reasons why inflation could continue to spike upward. First, tax revenues bubble up when inflation rates are high. This allows for a very loose fiscal policy and boosts inflation, again. Second, a labor market in full employment and an acute shortage of labor and skilled workers raises wages. This is particularly true due to the impending wave of retirements, which is likely to increase demand for workers. Strong interest rate hikes increase the risk of recession and the risks to financial market stability. Therefore, central banks may tend to raise interest rates only tentatively. However, the history from the 1970s and the interest rate shock in the early 1980s teaches us that when inflation is structurally high, these risks are eventually accepted in order to bring inflation back under control. Bund yields rose from 5.2 in 1978 to 10.", "filename": "2023_Housing_market_outlook__Price_dip_and_interes.pdf"}, {"text": " But today those inputs to the math vary greatly, depending on local circumstances. In Japan, debt costs have moved far less than in other parts of the world, as inflation remains subdued and the Bank of Japan continues to exercise yield curve control . By contrast, Europes real estate yield starting point was exceptionally low and market interest rates have moved up much more markedly, making the math that much more impactful. Government policy also matters. As central banks seek to choke off inflation by tightening monetary policy, there is at least the reasonable expectation that some of that inflation will be passed into rents and thus property cash flows. But when governments employ long-term borrowing to bail out energy consumers in the short term, as is necessary in Europe, interest rates are pushed up further and the impact on property values may be more detrimental. As the UKs recent experience would suggest, credit markets can react swiftly to reflect changes in perceived debt sustainability.

As the partner in one lead- ing advisory firm explains, This is one of those cash is king situations where borrowing costs are higher, and if youre an all- cash buyer, those probably represent a disproportionate share of the people in the market today. Meanwhile, the same interest rate increases that reduce lever- aged returns and thus demand for real estate also make bonds and other interest-bearing investments more compelling. As the head of real estate banking at one investment bank explains, Rising bond yields are going to mean that real estate and other alternatives are all going to be facing less availability of capital and some outflows. And while interest rates are increasing, equity and bond prices have been falling, triggering the denominator effect for some institutional investors with asset allocations that must remain in balance. The denominator effect can be magnified because CRE values in a portfolio are generally appraisal-based, which tend to be backward-looking. However, the impact on CRE portfolios may not be severe this time.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " 6.3 Risk scenario: Further interest rate shock. The whatever it takes of the 2010s could turn into a whatever it may cost of the 2020s Our baseline scenario Price dip in the German housing market described here, which we first presented in the March 2021 housing market outlook, has often been described as optimistic. However, this will only persist if high inflation eases again and falls below the 2 target. Otherwise, there is a threat of further interest rate tightening. In the short term, the current high uncertainty and financial stability risks are likely to limit the potential for interest rate hikes. However, a look back at the 1970s teaches us that central banks eventually get 20 April 21, 2023 Germany Monitor 2023 Housing market outlook inflation under control, even if this comes at a huge cost. For example, inflation in the 1970s ended with the Volcker shock and massive interest rate hikes. These led not only to a severe recession, but also to the Latin American crisis. So if inflation remains structurally high, sooner or later interest rates could rise again sharply. House prices could then come under renewed pressure. In this scenario, however, almost all investments are likely to lose value, and investments in the German housing market could still perform relatively well compared with other asset classes.

The steep turnaround in interest rates triggered a price correction on the real estate markets from the spring onwards, whereby the uncertainty about the extent and duration of the correction led to many investors temporarily withdrawing from the market. The turnaround in interest rates now appears to be largely complete and on this basis, we believe that a reliable price level should re-emerge on the real estate markets in the course of 2023, possibly as early as the spring.

If by 2030 house prices were again to increase at 1 point above inflation, and assuming an average inflation rate of 3 annually, then house prices would increase by 4 annually. Rental growth is expected to be similar, so initial rental yields would run sideways at today's levels. In this scenario, rental yields remain at their current level of 3.7. The housing market would remain attractive in this scenario, but in addition to the higher financing costs, refurbishment costs, CO2 levies and the like would have to be paid from the yields.

The following consequences are likely to result from an environment with structurally high inflation, a tendency toward somewhat higher nominal interest rates and negative real interest rates. First, prices will probably remain under pressure until the end of the interest rate hikes. Second, highly leveraged projects are significantly riskier than in the past decade, which should put the brakes on risk-taking investors. This scenario would therefore continue to allow risk-averse, long-term investors to achieve decent returns. 4.5 Risk scenario for 2023 and later: Structurally high inflation There are two main reasons why inflation could continue to spike upward. First, tax revenues bubble up when inflation rates are high. This allows for a very loose fiscal policy and boosts inflation, again. Second, a labor market in full employment and an acute shortage of labor and skilled workers raises wages. This is particularly true due to the impending wave of retirements, which is likely to increase demand for workers. Strong interest rate hikes increase the risk of recession and the risks to financial market stability. Therefore, central banks may tend to raise interest rates only tentatively. However, the history from the 1970s and the interest rate shock in the early 1980s teaches us that when inflation is structurally high, these risks are eventually accepted in order to bring inflation back under control.

For example, inflation in the 1970s ended with the Volcker shock and massive interest rate hikes. These led not only to a severe recession, but also to the Latin American crisis. So if inflation remains structurally high, sooner or later interest rates could rise again sharply. House prices could then come under renewed pressure.

We also highlight opportunities for investors in the current environment, and what their strategy can be. We discuss how they can position their portfolios, and which sectors we think are the most defensive. We then look at prospects for the life sciences sector against a backdrop of slower VC funding.

However, we do not think that prices fully reflect higher interest rates yet. To assess when values might bottom out, we can look to past downturns and the listed market for guidance. In the Global Financial Crisis, for example, global capital values bottomed out in 4Q09, while GDP across global real estate markets troughed three quarters earlier, in 1Q09, as did global listed real estate prices1. Market downturns usually present opportunities, and one we expect for investors in 2023 is a correction in pricing as the market adjusts to higher interest rates. Although we do not expect large amounts of distress in the market, we do expect some, already apparent in parts of the UK market. This should allow investors access to assets at attractive pricing.

In such situations, sellers may be willing to accept below-market prices, or indeed have to, in order to facilitate a sale.

Given the higher interest rate environment, we also think that floating rate real estate debt is an attractive way to achieve strong inflation protected returns and generate a good income return from real estate.

At the time of writing, there is little market evidence of repricing of privately owned prime offices, but we estimate that average- quality office values may have fallen by roughly 15 by the end of Q4 2022 since their peak at the end of 2021. This amounts to a yield expansion of about 50bps. A yield correction is also on the cards for prime offices in Europe, but the increase is likely to be more moderate.

Ten-year Bund yields increased from minus 0.4 per cent last December to nearly 1.8 per cent in June 2022, before slipping back to just over 1.5 per cent by the beginning of September. This has eroded the yield advantage of real estate investment. Although initial rental yields for commercial real estate and residential portfolios have fallen in a similar way to bond yields in recent years, their high yield advantage largely continued until 2021.

We have already started to see cap rates and yields rise in many markets, with the most rapid adjustment taking place in the UK. However, we do not think that prices fully reflect higher interest rates yet. To assess when values might bottom out, we can look to past downturns and the listed market for guidance.

In an August 2022 survey by the National Association of Business Economics, only a quarter of economists were even somewhat confident that the Fed could bring down inflation to its target range without causing a recession. Worrying signs out of Europe in early autumn and expectations of soaring heating bills this coming winter add to the gloomy global economic outlook. These conditions would be problematic for property markets: slowing or falling economic growth dampens tenant demand, while higher interest rates raise the cost of developing or acquiring properties. Both factors would cut returns and reduce values. Indeed, rising interest rates and uncertainty over future market conditions are already killing deals since sellers have not been ready to capitulate to buyers growing demands for price concessions, as we discuss in our capital markets trend.

The End of the Beginning But there is one issue on which our interviewees agree: The exis- tential risk for the real estate economy right now is that Fed action in response to persistent inflation will tip us into a recession, says a senior partner with a leading advisory firm. But can the Federal Reserve Bank tame inflation without breaking the economy? Moderating inflation rates this summer led many to believe that the worst was over and that the Fed could soon ease up its con- tractionary monetary policy. Indeed, the consensus of experts we interviewed this summer was that the Fed would cease tightening by the end of 2022 and start cutting rates again in mid-2023. That sentiment now appears optimistic. Inflation is going to be a little stickier than people think, said an investment banking executive we interviewed during the summer, whose views turned out to be more prescient. Sentiment started changing in late August when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell gave his annual speech to fellow central bankers affirming the Fed view that infla- tion is not nearly under control, jolting markets. Any remaining doubt about that was quashed by the official Fed commentary accompanying their September rate announcement projecting that rates would keep rising through 2023.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": "4 How can investors respond to these developments? The following consequences are likely to result from an environment with structurally high inflation, a tendency toward somewhat higher nominal interest rates and negative real interest rates. First, prices will probably remain under pressure until the end of the interest rate hikes. Second, highly leveraged projects are significantly riskier than in the past decade, which should put the brakes on risk-taking investors. This scenario would therefore continue to allow risk-averse, long-term investors to achieve decent returns. 4.5 Risk scenario for 2023 and later: Structurally high inflation There are two main reasons why inflation could continue to spike upward. First, tax revenues bubble up when inflation rates are high. This allows for a very loose fiscal policy and boosts inflation, again. Second, a labor market in full employment and an acute shortage of labor and skilled workers raises wages. This is particularly true due to the impending wave of retirements, which is likely to increase demand for workers. Strong interest rate hikes increase the risk of recession and the risks to financial market stability. Therefore, central banks may tend to raise interest rates only tentatively. However, the history from the 1970s and the interest rate shock in the early 1980s teaches us that when inflation is structurally high, these risks are eventually accepted in order to bring inflation back under control.

The starting signal for this could be more cautious communication by the ECB with regard to further interest rate hikes and a continued cautious approach to reducing bond purchases. As a result, mortgage rates should also fall again, uncertainty among investors should decrease noticeably and the positive price drivers should take over. In many respects, the historical model for current developments is the 1970s. Then, too, there were energy crises, high wage settlements, loose fiscal policy, and wars. In that decade average inflation increased by 5 annually and house prices by 6. If by 2030 house prices were again to increase at 1 point above inflation, and assuming an average inflation rate of 3 annually, then house prices would increase by 4 annually. Rental growth is expected to be similar, so initial rental yields would run sideways at today's levels. In this scenario, rental yields remain at their current level of 3.7.

We are reluctant to make investment decisions based solely on a view of future interest rates, but acknowledge that real estate pricing is linked to future interest rates. Given this dynamic, we recommend investors consider a range of interest rate scenarios . Interest rate increases and the relentless math Each time interest rates ticked higher since the GFC, the question of when higher debt costs would impact real estate values was asked. It was a speculative question, with the underlying assumption that rate increases thus far had not yet impacted values. Regardless of the answer then, it became very clear in 2022 that the relentless math of higher borrowing rates was having an impact on leveraged returns and asset values . The boost investors were getting from borrowing has shifted to a drag on a cash basis, but with unleveraged internal rates of return generally above borrowing rates, leverage is still marginally accretive on a total return basis. However, with less lift from borrowing, leveraged buyers are largely out of the market . Higher borrowing rates are a function of both higher indices and increased borrowing spreads. Lending volume is down significantly and lenders are becoming more conservative.

But until that occurs, properties will be offered on the hope that aspirational pricing targets anchored on peak levels will be achieved and a bid-ask gap will persist. Our expectation is that transaction activity will be below average in 2023, but start to recover in some sectors later in the year. While unleveraged buyers are not directly impacted by higher interest rates, they are also shifting their pricing and buying activity. They are adjusting their cost of capital in response to the broader capital markets, and unleveraged or low-leverage buyers are capital constrained as well. Higher interest rates have hurt the value of investors broader investment portfolios, triggering the so-called denominator effect, contributing to less competitive and less aggressive pricing for real estate. Private real estate pricing will adjust most quickly to the reality of higher interest rates in the sectors with the greatest investor interest . The price discovery process will be much slower for sectors already seeing fewer transactions, such as offices.

According to Statistics Canada, construction job vacancies reached a record high in the first quarter of 2022 and were double the number of open positions during the same period in 2020. And then there is the impact of construction wages, which were up 6.6 percent in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2021. All of this has made completing projects on time and on budget even harder than in the past, and the situation is unlikely to improve in the foreseeable future. The shortage of trades labor is not expected to get better any time soon and construction technologies have yet to evolve to make up the difference in cost or productivity. Adaptation Key as the Landscape Shifts for Canadian Real Estate What does this mean for real estate companies? For some, it adds further to the need to take a pause on activity. There have been rising projections, for example, of developers delaying or potentially canceling condo projects as it becomes harder to make the numbers work in these challenging conditions. Others are trying to manage this by spacing out advanced sales of new housing units to ensure that prices reflect rising costs as a project moves forward.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " For now, delays in new supply and elevated pre-leasing are keeping oversupply risk in check. Markets with high levels of construction include Dallas, Atlanta, the Inland Empire, Indianapolis, and Phoenix. As supply begins to come online, rent growth is expected to deceleratefirst, in untested sub- markets with elevated pipelines. Higher-barrier locations, on the other hand, may sustain higher rent growth for longer. Construction Is Battling Supply Chain Issues Real estate developers across the United States are confronting rising construction costs. Steel, concrete, and roofing materials contribute up to 80 percent of typical shell costs. Market price surges since the end of 2019 for these, and other major catego- ries, caused finished construction costs to spike by 50 percent. Construction durations in the broader industry have increased by two to three months, on average, since 2019, due to lon- ger material lead times and increasing contractor backlogs, according to a construction director at a large industrial owner. Advanced material procurement strategies and construction technology can resolve some ongoing construction issues. Developers are moving upstream in the value chain by lever- aging direct partnerships with national material suppliers to pre-secure and prioritize long-lead building materials and mitigate material shortages where possible. Developers are also introducing modularized construction systems to expedite repeatable project elements, such as office tenant improve- ments and in-warehouse restrooms, which reduce on-site construction timelines.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " Historically, affordability has played a key role in housing pur- chase decisions, and the rise in home prices along with higher mortgage rates has brought affordability to the forefront.

Cost Escalations amid Supply Chain Challenges and Labor Shortages On top of concerns about the capital markets are supply chain shortages and delays as well as significant increases in costs for labor and materials.

The head of an insti- tutional investment advisory firm says they are paying much closer attention to supply in traditionally unconstrained markets, especially Dallas, Atlanta, Austin, and Phoenix. We are prob- ably relatively less attracted to the growth markets despite their fundamentals, relative to where we were last year. These were the hot markets, but were a little concerned about what it looks like going forward. But dont count out these markets just yet. In-migration to these markets will continue, if at a slower pace going forward, and will continue to attract a disproportionate share of the investment capital. And any oversupply of homes could help ease hous- ing affordability concerns. Concludes the head of research for an investment management firm, Weve always been about growth markets because weve always believed that population and employment growth are keys to success. And they can also cover up a lot of mistakes. So those markets are still a major focus. 8. Smarter, Fairer Cities through Infrastructure Spending  Infrastructure spending is back among the top trends in Emerging Trends, but this time on a more hopeful note.  New federal infrastructure spending provides the opportu- nity to replace and expand critical urban infrastructure to rebuild cities and spur new developmentand address historical inequities.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " Technology can play a bigger role in actually delivering homes by helping bring innovation and cost efficiencies to a sector that has been notoriously slow to change. Most notable are different approaches to prefabricated and modular housing in which much or all of the house is built in a factory and then assembled on the homesite. These methods can dramatically reduce the need for labor and shrink production times at more affordable costs. Promising innovations are also arising from the nascent single-fam- ily build-to-rent sector, which is learning how to scale construction and design to reduce costs and development time, as explained in our single-family sector overview found in chapter 2. Government could also expand affordable housing produc- tion. Unfortunately, Congress dropped the affordable housing components of the proposed Build Back Better Act from what became the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, meaning that no additional federal help is on the way. But many state and local governments are stepping into the breach, as we discuss in our final trend on regulation. In the end, perhaps the most effective solution is the most obvi- ous: we must construct more housing that is affordable to more people. As the former homebuilder we quoted earlier puts it, what is needed is a new way of getting housing out there and get it built more affordably. 15 5.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " Ukrainian refugees and skilled workers likely to drive demand for housing 44 House building has lagged way behind immigration since the turn of the century New building has failed to keep up a high pace New building stalling in spite of rising demand for housing Housing markets became even tighter, not least because new building was very slow to react to rising numbers of immigrants.

Instead, however, housing construction has been slowing down again since 2019  falling to around 40,000 units by 2021. Building in towns and cities was hampered by the fact that the construction industry was working more or less at capacity, by a shortage of skilled workers and of materials, along with the emergence of protests here and there.

Today, with more than one out of three of Americas 44 million renter households earning less than $36,000 a year, roughly every other rental household puts more than 30 percent of their earnings toward rent. And one out of every four households spends 50 percent or more of their wages on housing. Those percentages reflect divides that deepen because not enough new apartment units are coming online. A present that is polarized grows more so over time. For market- rate property investors, developers, owners, and managers, what lies ahead is the brightest beacon of prosperity. But for those who live and reside below the cutline of wherewithal and social mobility, the future of apartment rentals holds more ques- tions than answers. With 1.3 million new U. S. households projected each year through 2035, apartment industry trade groupsthe National Multifamily Housing Council (NMHC) and the National Apartment Associationcalculate that the United States needs 4.3 million newly built apartments between now and then.

The Pandemic: This Time Is Different With the pandemic and the cascade of economic and social policies it set off, five macro apartment industry tailwinds reached gale-force levels:  One, there was a preexisting multigenerational avalanche of both rent-by-choice and rent-by-necessity demand for multifamily rental units.  Two, demand gathered speed and sweep as people sought larger living spaces to balance remote work and household life, and more outdoor living options.  Three, constrained construction of new supply, and a price run-up on the single-family for-sale front, spilled over into expanded apartment demand.  Lastly, compounding the effects of these four dramatic imbalances came the rocket fuel of a global capital rotation toward de-risked assets . Outsized demand, a sudden spike in remote work mobility, constricted supply, and floods of money with nowhere better to goa grand slam of anomalies. The U. S. apartment property sectorproviding shelter to 37 mil- lion residents in 21.3 million structures of five or more household units, and contributing $3.4 trillion annually to the U.

For example, according to the OECD which uses data from the Federal Statistical Office nominal house prices fell by almost 4 from peak to trough after the boom years of the 1970s. After the reunification boom in the housing market from 1995 to 2007, there was a drop of 8. So the current market correction of 3.6 is not unusual. However, this statement does not apply to real house prices. The very high inflation in 2022 caused house prices to plunge by more than 11 yoy, the sharpest real price decline in the entire time series.

Some indices show significant price declines, others are very restrained. The price expectations of potential buyers and sellers diverge. The number of transactions is very low. At current financing costs, prices would probably have to fall by about 20 from their peak to return to positive cash flow. However, five key arguments lead us to expect only a price dip. Negative real interest rates, inflation protection through real estate, rising rental growth and most importantly a high fundamental supply shortage. In addition, real house prices have already fallen very sharply due to the surge in inflation. Well-known price indices probably send different signals mainly due to different methods .

In the United States, 18 of single-family homes sold in the fourth quarter of 2021 were purchased by an institutional investor, the largest institutional share in more than 20 years.20 European residential investment has surged lately as well, topping 30 of total real estate deal flows through the first quarter of 2022.", "filename": "Deloitte 2023 Commercial Real Estate Outlook.pdf"}, {"text": " According to the vdp, new contract rents for multi-family homes rose by around 6  year-on-year in the fourth quarter both in the major cities and nationwide, the highest increase since the start of the series in 2004. Existing rents could also show a higher dynamic in future than in the past. For example, the difference between new leases and existing rents widened in the boom, which could increase the pressure. In addition, rents for index-linked leases rose automatically due to high inflation. Their share of all leases is likely to be small, but due to the bottlenecks analysed below, landlords are likely to be able to enforce them increasingly. Politicians are discussing capping index-linked rents. However, this discussion has only recently flared up, and there is no agreement on this in the coalition agreement. According to consumer price statistics, existing rents in March 2023 were already up 2.0 on the previous year, the highest figure since 1998 . In addition, the share of short-term rentals and furnished apartments that are not regulated by rent brakes and caps is increasing, which means that rents can rise more strongly. We therefore believe it is likely that existing rents could rise strongly on a sustained basis, at least if inflation remains structurally high. 2.", "filename": "2023_Housing_market_outlook__Price_dip_and_interes.pdf"}, {"text": " Note: 2022 figures are through July. they can go buy a house and its a little more affordable.

So far, migra- tion from the highest-priced markets has not been enough to actually reduce housing costs in those markets, though costs generally are rising more slowly there. Demographics and the slowing economy could also help ease the housing imbalance. The nations population is growing at its slowest pace ever, thanks to both low birth and immigration rates. And fewer buyers are on the hunt for homes now due to affordability and concerns about possible job losses in a recession. The good news is that it is an opportunity for home- builders and land developers to do a little catch-up. Theyve been running behind for two years, and they may actually welcome a little respite to finish the homes that they have sold, thinks a senior adviser to many homebuilders. But these favorable trends alone will not be nearly enough to solve the affordability quandary. What else would help?

Bottom formation will be near if interest rate rises end soon We expect prices to fall by a further 2 in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter.

The starting signal for this could be more cautious communication by the ECB with regard to further interest rate hikes and a continued cautious approach to reducing bond purchases. As a result, mortgage rates should also fall again, uncertainty among investors should decrease noticeably and the positive price drivers should take over. In many respects, the historical model for current developments is the 1970s. Then, too, there were energy crises, high wage settlements, loose fiscal policy, and wars. In that decade average inflation increased by 5 annually and house prices by 6. If by 2030 house prices were again to increase at 1 point above inflation, and assuming an average inflation rate of 3 annually, then house prices would increase by 4 annually. Rental growth is expected to be similar, so initial rental yields would run sideways at today's levels. In this scenario, rental yields remain at their current level of 3.7. The housing market would remain attractive in this scenario, but in addition to the higher financing costs, refurbishment costs, CO2 levies and the like would have to be paid from the yields.

As one housing industry adviser notes, Theres a stress index about global supply chains, and those stress indices are all indicating that theyre moderating, but theyre still at very high levels. Finally, high permitting fees and utility charges and large minimum lot sizes push developers to build more expensive homes.

Taking into account energy-related refurbishment costs for existing properties is likely to explain the divergence.

On the supply side, the shortage of labor and skilled workers is likely to intensify over the decade as a whole. As a result, the ambitious new construction and refurbishment targets will be difficult to achieve. On the demand side, the rise in energy prices and the consideration of the costs of climate change are likely to lead to a shift away from buildings with high emissions and toward low-emission buildings. The CO2 tax is already making energy costs more expensive. In the next few years, the EU taxonomy will require larger companies and institutional investors to publish their ESG footprint annually.

According to Statistics Canada, construction job vacancies reached a record high in the first quarter of 2022 and were double the number of open positions during the same period in 2020. And then there is the impact of construction wages, which were up 6.6 percent in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2021. All of this has made completing projects on time and on budget even harder than in the past, and the situation is unlikely to improve in the foreseeable future.

Adaptation Key as the Landscape Shifts for Canadian Real Estate What does this mean for real estate companies? For some, it adds further to the need to take a pause on activity. There have been rising projections, for example, of developers delaying or potentially canceling condo projects as it becomes harder to make the numbers work in these challenging conditions. Others are trying to manage this by spacing out advanced sales of new housing units to ensure that prices reflect rising costs as a project moves forward.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " There has been increased recognition that supply is the crux of the challenge, and governments at all levels have announced efforts to address that. We have seen initiatives from higher levels of government to encourage faster development approvals by municipalities, new money to incentivize construction of affordable homes, and policy changes aimed at facilitating the building of modestly denser forms of housing, like duplexes, triplexes, and mid-rise buildings, in urban areas currently reserved for single-family units. While the increased acknowledgment of the supply gap is posi- tive and the initiatives in response are welcome, the actions fall have been taking on their own, with one describing efforts to make a small number of units more accessible by modifying deposit structures. One interviewee discussed their efforts to increase efficiencies by shifting certain engineering and construction activities to happen earlier in the design pro- cess. Another interviewee emphasized the need for more collaborative partnerships among industry players, nonprofit organizations, and governments to deliver affordable hous- ing. There are many examples of creative partnerships and approaches to building affordable homes in Canada that, with the right funding and incentives from governments, can make a difference if applied more broadly.

Steel, concrete, and roofing materials contribute up to 80 percent of typical shell costs. Market price surges since the end of 2019 for these, and other major catego- ries, caused finished construction costs to spike by 50 percent.

Advanced material procurement strategies and construction technology can resolve some ongoing construction issues. Developers are moving upstream in the value chain by lever- aging direct partnerships with national material suppliers to pre-secure and prioritize long-lead building materials and mitigate material shortages where possible.

Compared to the rampant development of subprime markets prior to 2008, tighter credit standards today have built a stable foundation for longer-term fixed-rate mortgages.

We are reluctant to make investment decisions based solely on a view of future interest rates, but acknowledge that real estate pricing is linked to future interest rates. Given this dynamic, we recommend investors consider a range of interest rate scenarios . Interest rate increases and the relentless math Each time interest rates ticked higher since the GFC, the question of when higher debt costs would impact real estate values was asked. It was a speculative question, with the underlying assumption that rate increases thus far had not yet impacted values. Regardless of the answer then, it became very clear in 2022 that the relentless math of higher borrowing rates was having an impact on leveraged returns and asset values . The boost investors were getting from borrowing has shifted to a drag on a cash basis, but with unleveraged internal rates of return generally above borrowing rates, leverage is still marginally accretive on a total return basis. However, with less lift from borrowing, leveraged buyers are largely out of the market . Higher borrowing rates are a function of both higher indices and increased borrowing spreads. Lending volume is down significantly and lenders are becoming more conservative. The supply of debt capital from large money center banks is down due to large positions taken in the first half of 2022 coupled with stress testing.", "filename": "isa-outlook-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " Says the regional leader of one global firm, Cap rates have gapped out as interest rates went up. And suddenly, things didnt pencil, and that generated broken deals. The cost of financing for real estate and everything else went up dramatically. And so everything has to be repriced, everything has to be reset. Also limiting investor demand: debt is getting more difficult to obtain, and the Emerging Trends survey expects underwriting standards to get even more rigorous. As the partner in one lead- ing advisory firm explains, This is one of those cash is king situations where borrowing costs are higher, and if youre an all- cash buyer, those probably represent a disproportionate share of the people in the market today. Meanwhile, the same interest rate increases that reduce lever- aged returns and thus demand for real estate also make bonds and other interest-bearing investments more compelling. As the head of real estate banking at one investment bank explains, Rising bond yields are going to mean that real estate and other alternatives are all going to be facing less availability of capital and some outflows. And while interest rates are increasing, equity and bond prices have been falling, triggering the denominator effect for some institutional investors with asset allocations that must remain in balance. The denominator effect can be magnified because CRE values in a portfolio are generally appraisal-based, which tend to be backward-looking. However, the impact on CRE portfolios may not be severe this time.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " Given the current macro environment, we believe that investor expectations of rental growth are not sufficiently high for this in any sector. The logistics market and the less regulated part of the residential market might be an exception. But here, too, the uncertainty about further developments is likely to be too great, at least temporarily. Another relevant lower edge for property yields is financing costs. At the end of the third quarter of 2022, prime yields in all major market segments were below the cost of debt capital . This situation could only persist if the number of equity buyers is sufficiently large. Indeed, such investors are currently quite active and are taking advantage of the lower prices for purchases. However, we think it unlikely that the existing equity volume will be sufficient to anchor prices below the cost of financing. The fact that the increase in initial yields is nevertheless likely to be comparatively flat is also due to the mostly comfortable financing situation on the part of the landlords. Apart from the project development segment, we expect few forced sales. We rule out a wave of non-performing loans like after the financial crisis. Nevertheless, the steep rise in interest rates is likely to put individual landlords under stress, especially in the value-add and opportunistic segments, where financing durations are typically short. Lower demand for space and rents due to the recession could jeopardise the implementation of the business plan and thus also refinancing.", "filename": "outlook-real-estatet-market-germany-dec-2022.pdf"}, {"text": " The surge continued into 2022, with sales volumes in the first half of the year up 38 percent over the same period last year, as even the sharp rise in interest rates did little to dampen transaction volumes. But these recent volumes do not tell the whole storyand the story they do tell may be misleading as to where property markets seem to be heading. Discussions with numerous participants from all corners of the industry confirm that many investors have moved to the sidelinesor to other types of assets like equities and bonds. Indeed, the recent surge may well reflect a last gasp to get deals done before the expected increase in interest rates. Fewer Investors Fewer investors and lenders will be providing capital for assets, according to this years Emerging Trends survey: expectations of availability declined for every one of the 13 equity and debt capital sources. Over the past decade, CRE markets benefited from a substantial capital inflow as alternative investment classes have gained wider acceptance and real estate offered compel- ling risk-adjusted returns. Now, some of those inflows look to reverse. Investor interest is still healthy, but not what it was. Instead of seven or 10 competing offers for sale, theres now two or three, which I think thats normal, says the head of an investment firm. Thats normalizing, too. Several forces look to restrict investor demand, starting with the lower expected returns discussed in our Normalizing trend.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " Secondly, in an environment of rising interest rates, lenders can use the equity released from repaid loans to grant new, higher-interest loans. In this respect, it could be that lenders in many cases are aiming for a speedy redemption of loans. In addition to refinancing issues, there are other reasons for an increasing number of sales. For example, the devaluation of equities and bonds may have led to real estate quotas above target in some portfolios. This could trigger sales. Liquidity bottlenecks in open-end funds due to cash outflows could also make sales necessary. Against this backdrop and based on our observation that the number of sales processes started has already risen in recent weeks, we expect more supply again in perspective than recently. The big unknown is how much demand this supply will be matched by. In principle, many investment managers and other capital collection agencies still have plenty of money to invest, and capital sources such as insurance companies and pension institutions are continuously receiving more money to invest. However, the trend in recent years of more and more of this money flowing into the real estate markets may have been broken with the turnaround in interest rates. The artificially low interest rates have made the money and bond market unattractive for many years. In addition, central banks have squeezed private investors out of the market with their securities purchase programmes and forced them to invest their money elsewhere, including in real estate.", "filename": "outlook-real-estatet-market-germany-dec-2022.pdf"}, {"text": "5 Spiking rates drive rapid tightening of financial conditions Cost of capital rising sharply in most geographies Nominal corporate bond yields 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 7 0 n a J 8 0 n a J 9 0 n a J 0 1 n a J 1 1 n a J 2 1 n a J 3 1 n a J 4 1 n a J 5 1 n a J 6 1 n a J 7 1 n a J 8 1 n a J 9 1 n a J 0 2 n a J 1 2 n a J 2 2 n a J US C. Europe Singapore Japan United Kingdom Australia Canada Source: Bloomberg. As of November 30, 2022. LOOKING AHEAD  The relentless math of higher interest rates will continue to weigh heavily on real estate values, at least until interest rates stabilize as inflation begins to subside. The bid- ask spread for private real estate should eventually close and transactions will resume in earnest at a rebased level.  In the meantime, investment styles that are less sensitive to volatility in values should be contemplated, such as floating-rate lending with a comfortable cushion from lower loan-to-value ratios.", "filename": "isa-outlook-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " Overall, we think that global capital values will bottom out in the second half of 2023, with the timing dependent upon how the economy fairs and a longer adjustment possible. 1 According to MSCI Global Quarterly Property Index and FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Index in USD. For example, owners who are forced to sell assets because they are unable to refinance debt or need to sell for other reasons, such as generating liquidity quickly. In such situations, sellers may be willing to accept below-market prices, or indeed have to, in order to facilitate a sale. For investors wanting to deploy capital now, holding off for a few months as pricing adjusts is probably the best strategy. Given the higher interest rate environment, we also think that floating rate real estate debt is an attractive way to achieve strong inflation protected returns and generate a good income return from real estate. Finally, looking across the globe, another potential opportunity for investors in 2023 is Japan, due to accretive hedging gains for investment into this market. Indeed, investors need to be mindful of large differences in monetary policy as interest rate differentials between countries determine the cost of hedging. Currently, Japan is particularly attractive on an after-hedging basis, since interest rates there are lower than in other markets. Page 3 of 8 What opportunities exist for investors in 2023?

Note: Based on U. S. respondents only. More a Lull Than a Crash If transaction volumes do fall, few real estate people expect a crash or liquidity crunch in property markets. Notably, there are few signs of distress. Balance sheets are generally strong, lever- age is low, and values have not fallen very far, so few assets are underwater with their debt. Moreover, replacement financing is generally still available for those who need it, if at a higher price and with tighter underwriting. Many investors and developers are willing to look beyond the short-term turbulence to focus on longer-term opportunities, a theme we introduced in our open- ing overview. Thus, there are few examples of motivated sellers in the market.", "filename": "Emerging-Trends_USCanada-2023.pdf"}, {"text": " When new pricing is established, it will provide market evidence to help brokers supply accurate opinions of value and enable sellers to have realistic pricing expectations. But until that occurs, properties will be offered on the hope that aspirational pricing targets anchored on peak levels will be achieved and a bid-ask gap will persist. Our expectation is that transaction activity will be below average in 2023, but start to recover in some sectors later in the year. While unleveraged buyers are not directly impacted by higher interest rates, they are also shifting their pricing and buying activity. They are adjusting their cost of capital in response to the broader capital markets, and unleveraged or low-leverage buyers are capital constrained as well. Higher interest rates have hurt the value of investors broader investment portfolios, triggering the so-called denominator effect, contributing to less competitive and less aggressive pricing for real estate. Private real estate pricing will adjust most quickly to the reality of higher interest rates in the sectors with the greatest investor interest . The price discovery process will be much slower for sectors already seeing fewer transactions, such as offices.

Such problems include those that affect the quality of life and standard of living . These side effects to unfettered growth bring to mind the old joke about the hot restaurant that is so popular that no one wants to go there anymore. The Sun Belt markets are still strong population and business magnets, but they may now draw fewer and different people as their appeal changes. Becoming a 24-Hour City Though still ranked among the highest of all markets, some high-flying Sun Belt metros declined in ratings this year. Housing is more expensive, traffic is getting worse, longtime residents are getting frustrated, and even some newcomers are finding the proverbial grass to be not quite as green as they envisioned. In focus groups with local market experts conducted by ULI district councils across the United States, participants from the Supernovas and some other Sun Belt markets were likelier than members from metro areas with more sluggish economies to cite issues like living costs, housing affordability, and infrastruc- ture quality as being a regional disadvantage.

Moving beyond sector selection In the US, sector selection is likely to remain important to investors due to the uniquely dim outlook for its office market. But investors can still develop an edge by identifying the best markets and strategies within sectors. There are a wide range of metro areas in North America for an investor to sort through to identify the best targets and there is no shortcut around doing the work to identify the best-positioned markets. The rent growth outlook, in combination with pricing and market risk factors, remain paramount in this selection process. An additional lens we are putting into that market selection process is exposure to climate change risks.

Ironically, the affordability challenges extend to a subgroup we call the Affordable West. These markets are, indeed, more affordable than the ultra-pricey West Coast markets, especially those in California. But population growth has outpaced hous- ing development, pushing up home prices faster than local incomes. Much of the population growth in these markets has been fueled by the in-migration of households seeking more affordable housing, suggesting that growth could soon slow in some of these markets, absent an easing in home prices.

Wealth tends to be concentrated in larger urban centres with better employment opportunities where the average age of the working population is lower than in regional and more remote communities. Demand for living assets remains strong in most urbanised areas due to demographic growth and the rising number of households, boosted by immigration and the expanding number of younger and older people living alone. The volume of new housing developments is also falling due to increasingly stringent environmental rules, shortages of materials and rising labour costs. Demand continues to outstrip supply, especially in the affordable segment. If the number of new-build projects continues to decline, the valuations of existing stock may hold up relatively well. Increases in mortgage rates mean home ownership will move out of reach of a growing group of people, forcing them to turn to the rental market for accommodation that fits their budgets. Residential real estate is seen as a relatively good inflation hedge as most rental contracts are index-linked but, in our view, it will not be possible to pass on the full level of consumer price rises to tenants.

Compared to the rampant development of subprime markets prior to 2008, tighter credit standards today have built a stable foundation for longer-term fixed-rate mortgages. Global markets such as Germany and the United Kingdom have also increasingly adopted this mortgage structure.24 And prices continue to be propped up as the housing market remains woefully undersupplied, exacerbated by pandemic-related construction delays, shortages of materials and labor, and supply chain bottlenecks.25 In the United States, housing specialists dont foresee average global home prices falling over the coming year, but pockets in the most overvalued regions could experience corrections, especially if local governments intervene.26 Deleveraging initiatives by the government in China Mainland, for instance, have slowed investment and prices have slumped.27 Deloittes baseline economic forecast still expects house prices to rise faster than inflation,28 at least in the United States.

We also highlight opportunities for investors in the current environment, and what their strategy can be. We discuss how they can position their portfolios, and which sectors we think are the most defensive. We then look at prospects for the life sciences sector against a backdrop of slower VC funding.

With increasing rent levels, occupiers are now typically looking for high-quality, efficient spaces to match sky- high premiums. To better attract and retain tenants, owners and investors can enhance tenant experiences by leveraging data analytics, and more specifically, special intelligence tools, which can allow tenants to personalize their spaces to maximize productivity.48  Most respondents continue to have well-founded concerns about supply chain disruptions and construction costs due to construction delays and soaring land and materials costs. To address supply constraints, CRE leaders should focus on creative property-use conversions and targeted location strategies that tap into shifting demographic gateways.  Sources of funding may pull back in the near term as firms reassess their risk tolerance as they face volatile market conditions.

By contrast, Europes real estate yield starting point was exceptionally low and market interest rates have moved up much more markedly, making the math that much more impactful. Government policy also matters. As central banks seek to choke off inflation by tightening monetary policy, there is at least the reasonable expectation that some of that inflation will be passed into rents and thus property cash flows. But when governments employ long-term borrowing to bail out energy consumers in the short term, as is necessary in Europe, interest rates are pushed up further and the impact on property values may be more detrimental. As the UKs recent experience would suggest, credit markets can react swiftly to reflect changes in perceived debt sustainability.

In such situations, sellers may be willing to accept below-market prices, or indeed have to, in order to facilitate a sale. For investors wanting to deploy capital now, holding off for a few months as pricing adjusts is probably the best strategy. Given the higher interest rate environment, we also think that floating rate real estate debt is an attractive way to achieve strong inflation protected returns and generate a good income return from real estate. Finally, looking across the globe, another potential opportunity for investors in 2023 is Japan, due to accretive hedging gains for investment into this market. Indeed, investors need to be mindful of large differences in monetary policy as interest rate differentials between countries determine the cost of hedging. Currently, Japan is particularly attractive on an after-hedging basis, since interest rates there are lower than in other markets. Page 3 of 8 What opportunities exist for investors in 2023?

However, unlike the US, the major driver of European inflation is an exogenous energy price shock, rather than rampant domestic demand. The ECB and BoE will continue to raise interest rates to defend currencies to avoid importing more inflation and to manage the inflationary effects of Europes tight labor markets. However, with core price pressures less pronounced than in the US and weaker long-term demographic drivers of inflation in Europe, it is likely that both the peak level and equilibrium rate of monetary policy will be lower in Continental Europe than in the US. Nevertheless, for the moment the repricing pressure on Europes lowest-yielding property sectors is profound. Buyers not using leverage have an opportunity to set pricing at the margin and they have been among the few active players. However, the opportunity cost of doing so given the returns on offer in other asset classes, such as fixed income, means that real estate capital markets will likely stall until bid- ask spreads narrow further. Capitulation is more likely to come from sellers than buyers.

In Japan, yield curve control comes at the cost of a weak yen. If the Bank of Japan (BoJ) remains committed to keeping interest rates near zero, currency intervention, such as yen-buying to prevent further depreciation, could be on the table again. However, currency intervention has rarely been successful absent the cooperation from other central banks. Any changes to the yield control approach are likely to come after BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kurodas term concludes in April 2023.

From a German perspective, there is another question: how safe is Germany still perceived as an investment haven? For the moment, we believe we can observe that overseas investors at least have become more cautious. The economic weakness plays a role here, as does the war in Ukraine. On the other hand, the euro has depreciated and the interest rate differential of the euro area against most other currencies has increased significantly.

So far, migra- tion from the highest-priced markets has not been enough to actually reduce housing costs in those markets, though costs generally are rising more slowly there. Demographics and the slowing economy could also help ease the housing imbalance. The nations population is growing at its slowest pace ever, thanks to both low birth and immigration rates. And fewer buyers are on the hunt for homes now due to affordability and concerns about possible job losses in a recession. The good news is that it is an opportunity for home- builders and land developers to do a little catch-up. Theyve been running behind for two years, and they may actually welcome a little respite to finish the homes that they have sold, thinks a senior adviser to many homebuilders.

Even if affordability eventually improves with falling housing prices, the reality is that the key issue underpinning the crisis is insufficient sup- ply to meet high demand for all types of homes. Demand will continue to rise, especially as the Canadian government com- mits to higher immigration targets in the coming years and the country welcomes large numbers of temporary residents, like international students, who also need places to live.

And overall affordability pressures are affecting other classes of residential real estate as rising interest rates and the resulting challenges faced by homebuyers in qualifying for financing under the mortgage stress test push many potential purchasers to try to rent a home instead. But with supply also constrained and getting even tighter in the rental market, rising rents are adding to the growing affordability crisis. While the RBCs report noted that worsening affordability condi- tions would be particularly marked in relatively high-priced markets like Toronto and Vancouver, the challenges have been spreading across Canada as Canadians increasingly move to other communitieslike suburbs and evolving 18-hour cities as well as small towns and rural areasin search of cheaper places to live. Migration away from Canadas largest cities which still tend to see population increases as a result of high rates of international immigrationhas been a trend for some time, but the growth of remote working during the pandemic has exacerbated the move outwards and helped make affordability pressures more widespread.

But population growth has outpaced hous- ing development, pushing up home prices faster than local incomes. Much of the population growth in these markets has been fueled by the in-migration of households seeking more affordable housing, suggesting that growth could soon slow in some of these markets, absent an easing in home prices.
