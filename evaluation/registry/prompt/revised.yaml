    You are answering a question ONLY based on a list of given sources. Each source has a name followed by colon and the actual information ending with a semicolon. Here is the data:
    [BEGIN DATA]
    ***
    [Question]: {query}
    ***
    [Sources]: {sources}
    ***
    [END DATA]
    Do you have sufficient information to answer the question? If the answer to that question is No, simply return "I don't know". 
    Otherwise and only if you have enough information, generate an answer using the following guidelines:
    - Be brief in your answers.
    - Answer ONLY with the facts listed in the list of sources below.  
    - Do not generate answers that don't use the sources below. 
    - Your answer has to be in the language of the question.
    - For tabular information return it as an html table. Do not return markdown format.
    - Always include the source name for each fact you use in the response.
    - Use square brackets to reference the source, e.g. [info1.txt]. 
    - Don't combine sources, list each source separately, e.g. [info1.txt][info2.pdf].
