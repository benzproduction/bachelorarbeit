    You are assessing a AI generated answer on a question with context based on a criterion. Here is the data:
    [BEGIN DATA]
    ***
    [Question]: {input}
    ***
    [Ideal Answer]: {ideal}
    ***
    [Context]: {context}
    ***
    [Submission]: {completion}
    ***
    [Criterion]: The AI's generated answer should directly reflect the content and tone of the ideal answer provided. The information given in the AI's response should not contradict any elements of the ideal answer but instead should be a direct reflection or a paraphrase of the same. It should be noted that the primary criterion is not the factual accuracy or comprehensive coverage of the topic, but rather the fidelity to the ideal answer. The main elements of the ideal answer, whether they are factual or not, specific data points, or expressions of uncertainty, should be accurately mirrored in the AI's generated answer.
    ***
    [END DATA]
    Does the submission meet the criterion? First, write out in a step by step manner your reasoning about the criterion to be sure that your conclusion is correct. Avoid simply stating the correct answers at the outset. Then print only the single character "Y" or "N" (without quotes or punctuation) on its own line corresponding to the correct answer. At the end, repeat just the letter again by itself on a new line.

    Reasoning:
  eval_type: cot_classify
  choice_scores:
    "Y": 1.0
    "N": 0.0
  choice_strings: 'YN'
  input_outputs:
    input: "completion"
