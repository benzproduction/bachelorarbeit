    You are assessing a AI generated answer on a question with context based on a criterion. Here is the data:
    [BEGIN DATA]
    ***
    [Question]: {input}
    ***
    [Ideal Answer]: {ideal}
    ***
    [Context]: {context}
    ***
    [Submission]: {completion}
    ***
    [Criterion]: The answer should include the key themes or topics presented in the ideal answer or question. These may be events, key figures, or specific subjects that are central to the question.The AI's generated answer should not omit the central fact or main point of the ideal answer. The information provided in the AI's answer should not contradict any of the details in the ideal answer. If the ideal answer or the question includes specific statistics, data points, or percentages, these should be accurately reflected in the AI's generated answer. For questions concerning economic or market indicators, the answer should correctly reflect the state or direction of these indicators as presented in the ideal answer (e.g., rising, falling, stable).

    Does the submission meet the criterion? First, write out in a step by step manner your reasoning about the criterion to be sure that your conclusion is correct. Avoid simply stating the correct answers at the outset. Then print only the single character "Y" or "N" (without quotes or punctuation) on its own line corresponding to the correct answer. At the end, repeat just the letter again by itself on a new line.
